25	It s been a long time coming but I have made some serious decisions about my life Seven years ago I was 18 years old and the most naive person on the planet I thought that my life would go exactly as I had always planned I was going to finish college in three years as I had already amassed enough credits in high school to finish by the time I was 20 Then I would move victorious and complete in my own self worth to law school preferably Ivy League where I would be editor of the Law Review and graduate at the top of my class Then I would be ensconced as a junior associate at a top private law firm making 75 000 a year by the time I was 25 I turn 25 next month I only finished two years of college at two different schools before I quit I have spent the past five years working in an office and maintaining my job solely through my boss inexplicable liking of me because God knows I ve put him through hell I have moved 16 times in five years because I cannot keep an apartment or a roommate to save my life I have no savings and I have driven most of my friends away from my sheer hatred of myself Those who have stuck around I honestly don t know why I feel unworthy of having anyone give a damn about me I think about dying almost every day because it makes me feel relieved to think I can escape from all of the misery in which I have ensconced myself It s time to make a move I refuse to spend the rest of my life with barely enough money to live on I refuse to live any longer beneath my potential I refuse to give up on my life because there is still a lot I can do I m smart dammit I m better than this This is all contingent on student aid but I am moving back to Mississippi to go to the college at which I spent my disastrous freshman sophomore year Disastrous only because I was drunk both literally and figuratively with the idea of being away from my controlling unrelenting parents They had spent years hammering away at me making me study when I wanted to play eschewing any social life they perceived as damaging to their efforts to mold a daughter who would provide for them in their retirement Well not my mom so much But my dad insisted that I live my life solely to go to college I spent my childhood reading books At my father s urging I completed Robinson Crusoe at age 8 Nicholas Nickleby at age 10 Gone With the Wind at 11 Granted I love to read and that is due a lot to my father s influence But maybe my life would have worked out differently if I had not been under such hellish pressure to succeed My father and I were close growing up When I was a teenager I hated my mother as much as I loved my father there s a statement Freud would have a field day with My daddy took my side over my mother numerous times leading my mother to tell me regularly that I was going to cause them to divorce because they spent all their energy fighting over me When I was a teenager I found this funny Now I just find it sad In the back of my mind I always knew my father s love for me was contingent solely upon my intelligence and the fact that I excelled at school and gave him fodder for the watercooler at work My daughter just made Honor Society My daughter got scholarships from all six of the schools she applied to And so on And that all changed in an instant when I veered off his preset path When I dropped out of school at age 20 I dropped off his radar He never speaks to me If I call the house to talk to my mother he never says Hello or How ya doing or Fuck you It s just Hey Daddy it s me Oh I ll get your mother I think he literally hates me and doesn t even deign to put it into words At holidays I avoid him Thank God there are only two attendance required holidays in my family and they re only a month apart so that gives me 10 months to avoid him As much as things have worsened with my father they have improved with my mother I love my mother She listens to me and though she isn t always able to help me she tries which I more than I can say about my father Mama is great I regret I spent my teenage years hating her because we could have been spending time together and I might have realized sooner what I have My mother knows of my plans to move to MS She is under strict orders not to tell my father yet but she did warn me that the minute I cross the state line she is letting the cat out of the bag I don t care By then I ll be beyond his reach And the first time he calls me to demand to know my grades like he did every single week I was in MS before I will bitch him out like I have been dying to do for years This time whether I succeed or fail it s my own damn business Why did I decide to move back to MS Couldn t I go to college here Well I could But then I would still be around the crutches that I use every time I fall and that s not good for me I need to be someplace where it is all sink and swim and it s all me out there on my own For the first time in my life I want to be completely self sufficient I am setting myself up to fail spectacularly This is why I am being extra careful in my planning I have to make sure all of my little ducks are in a row before I screw myself over First things first I am moving to a place that is in the ghetto but is much much cheaper than where I have been living I have to start saving if my plan is going to work I ll be scared out of my mind but as long as I have a bed to sleep in and a lock on my door please God let there be a STURDY lock on the door then I will be fine Step two is to either fix the car I have problem with the fuel line or get a new car Do I trust old Silver my 93 Mustang to get me to MS and back three to four times a year Before March I would have said yes Now not so sure I ll still chewing on this problem The rest of my plan is still being fleshed out and I am getting anxious and trying to get this done before July so I can start for the summer session But I am trying to be patient and wait until fall Here s why The last time I took a sabbatical from my job loooong story I started back on July 14 of last year Coming up this July 14 on my one year anniversary I will have one week s vacation If I can wait that long I can cash it in before I quit and have the extra money plus whatever bonuses I earn between now and then The problem is that I don t really want to quit my job I want to work on my time off from school I ll have the entire month of December and May through August off every year and I will be spending them here in AL I have to see if my boss is amenable to that or even to letting me work comp in MS My job is all by phone anyway We ll have to see about that one I m not sure in fact I m almost positive he doesn t trust me enough to do that yet I finally feel optimistic and even hopeful for the first time in years If this works out I m on my way My worst enemy is myself If I can conquer that then I have nothing else to worry about To quote an old friend Life is study Consider me a devoted student

25	Happy 21st birthday to my baby brother Nick Have a beer on me baby bro God I m old I remember when we were kids and Nick was so small for his age that the day he started sixth grade and rode the middle school bus for the first time the bus driver told him to get off and wait for the elementary school bus and I had to tell her that he was older than he looked Now he s taller than me and has the beginnings of a beer gut according to my youngest brother John who sees him more than I do You have to understand Nick s a hermit I haven t seen him since Christmas even though I go to my parent s house at least once a month if not more He s either never there or holed up in his bedroom drawing something my baby brother is a kick ass anime artist I hope he buys some beer and brings it home to piss my dad off Ha Moving on What a day be warned loooong work rant ahead Cracky came back to work and seems to have learned the Workplace Golden Rule Thou shalt not deign to address the folks your absence screwed over She kept to her druggie self all day long and I was thankful for it The one time she addressed me I snapped at her and then she left me alone Hmph Blondie has to have major surgery next week and thus will be out for a good six weeks A bad six weeks on my part I lose my bitch partner I feel bad for her and selfishly I feel bad for myself that I ll have to deal without her The saddest thing is she s scheduled to come back after I leave for Mississippi So more than likely this is our last week working together Should I feel bad for encouraging her not to come back at all I know the place makes her miserable and after two and a half years working there Jefe still doesn t seem to like her very much and she tends to annoy the shit out of Posh I love her to death personally but I am also not biased enough to realize that she is not as good as myself and Barbie unfortunately and has not really progressed throughout her tenure at the company She stays steady but on a lower plane than the rest of us whereas I have a few lows and then many months of highs Jefe just doesn t seem to have taken a liking to her as he has to myself and Barbie and Posh I can t quite put my finger on why Speaking of liking according to Posh he was surfing the web and found something he really liked for me so he ordered it and she gave it to me today It s a set of Hello Kitty dominoes I freaking love it See the thing is only Posh and I get this kind of stuff Jefe always finds little butterfly things for her and Hello Kitty stuff for me but he has never had the inclination to search out stuff that Blondie might like or Barbie or Cracky for that matter Like I said it kinda stumps me mainly because I can t figure out why he likes me so damn much I make his life hell a vast majority of the time While I don t understand it I do appreciate the hell out of it It s nice to be thought of I think I am going to take advantage of the fact that Jefe seems to be in a good mood and ask him if I can go ahead and take a loan out on the vacation pay I will receive in the middle of July I really really must get my car fixed It s getting to the point where I am scared to drive it because it shakes and rattles so bad I mean it s getting me where I need to go but it s taking me forever because I have to stay off the interstate and preferably all major highways as well The day it breaks down I may break down as well And I don t want to get rid of the car because 1 I cannot afford a car payment right now or probably ever and 2 I really do like the Mustang especially when it s RUNNING Time to go watch some Jeopardy Since I haven t had occasion to really use my brain in oh five years I like to give it some exercise every now and then Besides that guy who keeps winning on there who s been on almost twenty times now and won more than half a million dollars kicks ass and I can t wait to see his eventual downfall I hope it s a woman that beats him 

25	Damn lasanga 

25	urlLink What Finding Nemo Character are You brought to you by urlLink Quizilla I loved this movie yesterday 

25	I make excellent lasagna Just ask Ricotta Monkey sorry Lisa but that was your only contribution after all So much for my great idea to start dieting this weekend Posh will kill me I promised to start so we can help each other But considering the fact that the girl is only looking to lose ten pounds that she really can t afford to lose I m not feeling too inclined to encourage her weight loss anyway I keep telling myself that when I get my Gazelle I will actually stick with it and use it every day I ve been lusting after one for a year so this is a realistic thought However knowing myself I know that I will probably be gung ho for a month and then store it under my bed never to be seen again C est la vie That s me I want to watch X 2 tonight I saw it when it came out in theaters but due to my squirrel sized bladder I missed a couple of parts of the movie Same with Harry Potter three weeks ago I need to go see it again because of my God forsaken useless Kegel muscles My Ben Wa balls will go to waste of this I am certain Anyway I am waiting for Lisa to make up her mind as to when she wants to start the movie She said earlier that she didn t want to watch Finding Nemo and lo and behold she showed up 15 minutes after I had started the movie and watched the whole thing Weirdo LMAO she just came in here waving a pencil with a penis or payness as she pronounced it eraser and yelled It s a glow in the dark tallywacker Between her glow in the dark eraser and my Day glo condom finger puppets we could have a really kinky adult puppet show going on up in here 

25	Oh what a busy fucking week it has been A crazy busy fucking week But first Happy birthday to me for another hour and a half I moved back in with Lisa today It s a good thing I can help her financially and I can save some money before I leave for Mississippi I m trying to be considerate and make sure that I know the score up front this time around I solemnly swear I will not eat your food and will use but 1 glass per week because the last time I lived with her we were both miserable I think this time will be better though Live and learn I wish I could have taken the day off for my birthday but I will settle for cashing in my vacation next month and taking a long weekend at the beach hey Lisa you provide the transportation I provide the accomodations huh And once I cash in my vacation pay I can get my freaking car fixed As it is now when trying to figure out how long it will take me to get somewhere I have to tack on an extra five minutes for every ten that it normally takes cuz that car takes its own sweet time going where the fuck it wants to go The reason I could not take off early today is because Crackhead has been out for three days but is miraculously well enough to come in and get her paycheck after work and Barbie had to leave early to go out of town why I ll never know since her destination is none other than Columbus where I will be living come fall and I know for a fact that it takes less than 2 hours to get there so why all the drama about having to leave early because she didn t want to be on the road all day Geez Plus I have been training a new girl I was thinking I would refer to her as Paris because her face resembles a certain amateur porn queen but I might change that to Rebel Yell because well she s just that country all week and I finally turned her over to Posh today because I just couldn t handle it anymore and that left two people Blondie and myself on the phone full time and one trainee who didn t know shit Not exactly an auspicious birthday if you know what I mean And more bad news to come I was really pushing for them to fire Crackhead in deference to Paris Rebel Yell but that probably won t happen now because Blondie is going in for surgery in two weeks and will be out for six weeks after that She probably won t come back until the week I leave funny So we can t afford to get rid of Crackhead because on the rare days that she does show up at least there s a trained Helper Monkey answering the phones even half assed as she tends to do Quote of the Day Paris Rebel Yell sitting at Cracky s desk Gosh none of her pens work Me That ain t the only thing around here that doesn t work ATTENTION LOSS OF IMPULSE CONTROL AHEAD For the love of all that is good and pure in this world Come to work bitch I dare you to actually work a full fucking week If not for your coworkers who could use the break for your crack habit That shit ain t free ya know And no one wants what you re selling Groooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnn And breathe I intend to spend the weekend relaxing trying to forget the idiocy that awaits me Monday morning and watching all the movies I ve missed on InDemand before the cable service is disconnected on Monday sigh There s like ten of them And no Lisa this will not be shades of marathon Sex and the City I will pace myself and only watch the most important Which may well be all of them Okay so I ll watch them at breakneck speed back to back Don t judge I am so glad to be sitting in this apartment right now I ve left the ghetto baby Movin on up to the East Side to a deluxe apartment in the sky Or a two bedroom walk in apartment by the duck pond Doesn t have the same ring Movin on up 

25	So Jefe comes in this morning at 9 00 when the phone has been ringing off the hook and it has already been back to back mania all morning And the first words out of his mouth Not Good morning That s too much to hope for No the first words out of his mouth are I have already gotten 2 complaints about rudeness so the next one I get I m knocking that person down to 5 15 hour for the entire week No explanation no justification I wonder if one of them was about me probably was I know one of them was about Crackhead She talked to a woman today who was bitching about being on hold and Cracky had her on mute and heard the woman say to the person in the background I m getting a fucking headache from this shit Cracky got back on the phone You have a headache Maybe you should take some Tylenol for that How can I help you Customer did not appreciate that very much This is my influence Oh well There is war being declared in my department because two of us Barbie and Cracky are not answering the damn phone when it rings and two of us Blondie and myself are picking up the slack Very very annoying I have spent the day bitching and complaining and making notes and insisting that we have a meeting this week so these issues can be addressed And they haven t been Oh my Gawd I almost forgot Cracky took off her bra in front of everyone today Did not need to see that And considering that she sits in front of a huge plate glass window I m certainly hoping no one outside saw that either She is so gross She gets these scabs on her forehead all the time and she sits there with a mirror propped up on her keyboard and picks at them and squeezes them all day long Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Take it to the bathroom Grossy Gross At home Far away from civilized people I hate that this entire post has been dedicated to work but I need to let it off somehow I cannot wait until August There s no place like school there s no place like school there s no place like school

25	It s been a long weekend I haven t really done anything It s just been a long weekend We have a new girl I want to tell her to run Far far away I want to warn her that this job will suck out her soul and leave behind an empty bitter shell of a human being I want to point to myself and say Hey New Girl take a look at what YOU LL be five years from now if you stay here Oy In the arena of good news I am only 20 bucks away from winning a Gazelle machine at work in the incentive program By next week hopefully I will have ordered it Yippee Only thing I have to look forward to this week Not happy about the birthday coming up I have this innate fear that everyone will either forget or not care enough to get me diddly shit After all of the birthdays I have helped compensate over the past year I d better be getting some good diddly shit I don t do it just to make sure I get gifts on my birthday though that is a major part of it People i e management at my job just don t take the time or have the inclination to help people celebrate it I always make sure I have a card and some little trinket or bauble to give to everyone at least those I know and care about within the company on their birthday To make them feel good Appreciated even They d better remember me Or come birthday time I will be pissed I am turning TWENTY FIVE That is a quarter of a century Two and a half decades I am fucking OLD And nowhere where I thought I d be by now I have spent the past seven years of my life on a derailed train hurtling towards oblivion I seriously think I must have broken a ton of mirrors in 1997 to be where I am today At least I m finally trying to get back on track 

25	I tried to do my personality cocktail I could not copy it onto this page for some reason Mine was 1 part competitiveness 5 parts humor 5 parts empathy I m not so sure about that 

25	It s days like this that make my decision to leave my job a no brainer I had a guy call me yesterday and act like a total prick then proceed to tell me that I am freaking rude Okay I let it slide said goodbye politely and hung up He called back today got me again and when I reminded him that I was the one he talked to yesterday he apologized twice for his behavior and very sweetly asked for an extension on his account Which due to my ever benevolent nature I granted without a problem He then proceeds to call back the application line and leave an anonymous complaint saying that the girl he talked to when he first called we call her Cracky as in crackhead was an angel and the girl he talked to next me was not So then Jefe calls Posh and demands to know what happened And Posh explains to Jefe that she knew about the call and that the prick had apologized twice for HIS rude behavior and said not a word to me about being rude to him And then she got pissed because he was questioning whether she had control of her department and as she told me she desperately wanted to tell him I know what goes on in my fucking department but unlike me who has called him all manner of names including dick with no regret she s too scared to tell him to his face what she thinks about his interference Oooooohhhhhh my aching head And Cracky didn t show up to work today and Barbie came in two hours late and I asked Jefe to buy me and Blondie some lunch for having to make up the slack and he said no So I ate Pizza Hut again And now my tummy hurts So like I said Knowing that if I stay here this is what my life will be like for years on end I say NOT I choose to move on Screw every one of them In other news I have discovered that yes my father really does hate me I am not exaggerating I called my mother today and casually mentioned that I had not gotten a response to an e mail I sent my father a week ago and she said Oh he told me to tell you blah blah blah I asked Mom Why couldn t he just hit the reply button and tell me that himself Neither of us answered the question because we already know the truth He fucking hates me So I told my mother he s not getting a Father s Day gift since he does not know how to behave like a father She also went against my wishes and told him I am going back to Mississippi She said he hopes you do well there Yeah right I only hope I do so I can have the pleasure of NOT inviting him to my graduation Asshole That ll teach him to treat his own daughter like she s expendable Nothing like having a goal in mind huh I m only a little bitter 

25	Conversation of the Day Posh So did you get any party favors at the sex toy party last week Me Yeah a Day Glo condom I gave it to Lisa Posh Why d ya do that Me What the hell else was I going to do with it It s not like I have any use for it other than painting a face on it and using it as a finger puppet I have circumvented the IRS take that bureaucratic assholes I called the Dubya and asked the financial aid office if they knew of a way to get a copy of my tax return She said she could mail me a form to request one Score V v good day today after a sad start Blondie co worker SH and yes Lisa to answer your question it was she that I had subterfuged yesterday came in this morning bawling because a friend of her family died in a car accident last night And her cousin died two weeks ago And to top it off as if her morning wasn t already shit she hit and killed a kitten on the way to work Jefe noticed was a little irritated that she was a mess and told Posh to send her home She left sobbing these little staccato bullet like sobs that made me feel so bad for her But is it also really really bad of me to be glad they sent her home I mean I could not have gotten anything done today if I was worrying about her being able to hold it together on the phone Right Then Posh told me that Jefe had a surprise for me He got me one of those full length massasing pads that goes in your chair and has three different speeds and HEAT oooohhhh massage Homina Love the folks at Homedics Found out that you cannot turn it on high while on the phone because my voice sounded like it does when someone is beating you on the back while you re talking Very cool for a party trick not so cool when trying to open an account over the phone Other downside it made me start bleeding again I swear if I jar my pelvis just a little bit it s like free rein to bleed like a muthafucka But you know what I ll bleed a river if the cause makes me feel SO DAMN GOOD The others are jealous And pissed And I don t care My boss loves me right now He told me my attitude is great my calls are fabulous and my performance is the best it has been in months He gave me the greatest compliment of all though when he said he has stopped focusing his energy on me and is going to leave me alone to do my thing Hallelujah Mr Gooooooden I love it when he lets me do my thing That means two to three months of freedom and MONEY He pays me well when he leaves me alone Of course I m set to screw him and not in a fun way in two months so my victory is tinged with bittersweetness But I m here now And I ll milk it for all I m worth 

25	The IRS sucks major ass I was on the phone with them for 20 minutes and ran over my lunch break waiting for some dumb heifer with the mental speed of a blind deaf mute to tell me that she can mail me a computer transcript of my tax return but she cannot send me a photocopy of the one I signed because they don t keep those Hello Aren t you the GD IRS Don t you people keep every fucking thing Yeah I ll probably be audited next year though good luck with that morons I have nothing Nothing In other news I completely subterfuged one of my coworkers today to get more money and recognition for myself And it worked amazingly enough I feel kind of bad for her because she s gonna be pissed when she comes to work tomorrow and finds that things have changed for her but oh well I have enough to worry about Like my boss finding out I am moving out of the state in two months With all of the perks I am getting right now it would be disastrous if my evil nefarious plans came to light before I m ready I m not manipulative I m just drawn that way BTW can I just say that I think it is so funny that Courteney Cox named her new baby girl Coco As in Chanel Or I m cuckoo for Coco puffs And I also think it s hilarious how Blogger will advertise certain things on your blog that they see in your posts For example Mine is now advertising tequila after this past weekend s debacle Maybe I should write an entire post about herpes and see if they advertise something along those lines Or maybe not My car is acting progressively worse and I am scared to get behind the wheel I know I am pushing my luck and every trip may be my last God if you let me make it through the next few weeks without breaking down I ll be very very good I ll eat my veggies and drink lots of water and be nicer to everyone Oh who am I kidding After that b s God may decide to blow up the car with me in it but please please don t Posh told us a joke today at work that her dad of all people told her What did one saggy tit say to the other We d better get some support before somebody thinks we re nuts 

25	Oh my aching head It s almost 10AM and why I am already at the library only God knows I was only able to sleep for 4 hours and then only sporadically Usually when I drink straight tequila which granted is rare I am down for the count the following day Other than a pounding headache though I feel rather lucid I remember Lisa throwing one of her Ben Wa balls after use at me she was WAY more drunk than me which is also rare She said I threw it back and hit her in the shoulder Ew I can t believe I actually touched it on a personal note I tried putting my own in this morning as a test run but for some reason I could not get them to stay in there And when they were in they would not move Aren t those little fuckers supposed to roll FYI for anyone who s interested Getting drunk last night was NOT my idea Yes I paid for half the tequila but then again we barely finished half the bottle I think I did 4 shots Lisa 3 or 4 I can t remember Plus I had a tubie Yum yum I did get readmitted to MUW without a problem And since I make a mere pittance at my job and my tax returns reflect that I have to provide proof of last year s income to the school so I can get my aid package set up And since I am a dumbass and did not make a copy of my tax return before mailing it in I need to figure out how to get it so I can send it to the school Any suggestions Why am I awake I need more sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 

25	I m at Lisa s I just had a tube shot My ears are already burning Bring on the Cuervo Ben Wa balls rock I love sex toy parties P S Lisa if I start biting you again after getting hyped up on tequila please feel free to knock the shit out of me 

25	I can t find a title I like I keep changing it every coupla days Eventually one will stick I kinda like this one I am tired I spent the entire morning at work trying to pretend that I wasn t tired I also spent the majority of the morning trying to convince Posh to convince El Jefe to let us take the day off work on Friday as it is the national day of mourning and the banks and post offices will be closed Even though Jefe is not even going to be there as he is going to opening night Van Hagar I mean Van Halen in North Carolina I don t think my idea is going to fly Pooh I feel really really sad about Ronald Reagan dying I mean he s the first president I can remember vaguely and my parents thought he was like a god Hell most people in the South did seeing as how you can t swing a dead cat around here and not hit a Republican It s like a piece of my childhood has died I admit it I cried when I heard about it then again I cry at everything so not a good example I still haven t heard from MUW I wonder if I got in The woman in Admissions said it would basically be a straight readmission and then I could contact the financial aid office to make sure they received my FAFSA and my student loan forms I also applied for work study I d rather work on campus than off Call of the day A Mexican guy calls in says he wants to know what youse peoples are going to do for him which is actually more Jersey than anything although this guy was from Arizona I explained that he called us in March asking the same question and our company still has the same function as it did then And when I continue to talk he starts to interrupt me with Miss miss over and over again though it sounds more like Meeeeese meeeeeese So I keep talking over him like I can t hear him because he is really getting on my nerves and he keeps it up Meeeese meeeese So finally Sir what can I do for you since you are intent on interrupting me this morning What are youse peoples going to do for me Sigh Didn t we explain this to you when you called in March I dunno Do you remember calling our company No How d you get the number I dunno So you just woke up this morning and said Hmm I think I ll call this random number today just to annoy people Is that it sir Pause I dunno Bigger sigh Do you know anything sir I deal with these kinds of people on a daily basis folks I can t wait to get a real job 

25	I have spent the entire day bleeding like someone jammed a faucet up there and turned it on full blast I hate my period Especially when it has lingered now for four looooong weeks I have to wait to stop bleeding profusely before I can schedule an appointment with the woman doctor though and judging from the way things are going that could be a while Now that I am done grossing myself and you out I have serious issues with my immediate supervisor We ll call her Posh since she looks almost exactly like Victoria Beckham a k a Posh Spice Posh has been working at the company for five years having started a month after me But whereas I have taken a sabbatical twice over the past several years my time served doesn t count As is my one year anniversary is next month Normally when someone makes it to five years they receive lunch on their anniversary some flowers and or balloons and a small bonus check Posh however having wended her way so sinuously into the inner sanctum of our boss received a Louis Vuitton wallet to match the 1500 Louis bag she just purchased a Louis Vuitton fountain pen really who needs that and a brand new completely tricked out cell phone Market value of all of this Oh about 700 That s all And I can t get any money to repair my car I dislike her because she shows off all of her stuff but acts like she s modest and embarrassed to be showing it to people She preens like a damn peacock She spent the past two days playing with the damn cell phone and not answering sales calls while we her department have been backed up and slammed with back to back calls And since my boss didn t make his happy way into work until almost 3 he saw none of this It s cathartic to write about here because if I had gone with my first instinct and walked into El Jefe s office and bitched about her behavior I probably would have been sent home As it is I ignored her all day which means he ll hear about it anyway because on days when I don t talk to her I have an attitude problem Oh well If she had her way I wouldn t have been given a raise last week And she wasn t supposed to know about it until she looked at my paycheck and saw it I don t know what her problem is She ll always make more than me and get more than me seeing as how her pig nose has a permanent brown cast to it from having been up the boss s ass so much Am I jealous Hell yes I ve been there longer sabbaticals nonwithstanding And I m better than her And smarter She s prettier but I m a hell of a lot smarter Shouldn t that count for something Oh wait I forgot where I work 

25	Oh what a day The trials and tribulations of the women I work with are unbelievable In the space of a weekend one relative has died and one husband has left Oh my aching head When it comes to those I love I like to think that I am a compassionate person when these people are in pain However my coworkers are something else I have to work with these people for crying out loud and most of the time I wish they would disappear It is hard to strike the right balance between professionalism i e not getting caught talking about personal issues during business hours and friendly interest and concern i e making people I don t really honestly care one whit about think that I am there for them in thick and thin And since it is naturally in my nature to gossip it is hard for me to keep things to myself So I want to tell other people about my coworkers sundry problems and then I realize that no one else really cares Which really bursts my bubble I feel for these women don t get me wrong But their problems pervaded MY work space today making our entire department suffer because people were down in the dumps all day and that makes our boring job even tougher to take You have to have a modicum positivity in there or it s all sink and no swim I cannot relate to someone whose husband has left them I CAN relate to someone who has lost a loved one as I lost my beloved Pa Paw almost ten years ago But I can t talk to someone about their recently deceased because it reminds me of my own pain and has me in inconsolable tears for hours I have yet to come to terms with my grandfather s death but that s a tale for another day when I am not so tired or emotional In short I am no good at dealing with other people s problems I have enough of my own to worry about and I have enough trouble trying to figure out how to solve those let alone the problems of the world I need a beer 

25	So here s the kink in the plan My boss I have the utmost amount of gratitude for the man who has kept me employed through thick and thin these past five years Without him I may have given up a long time ago and crawled under a rock to live out the rest of my days as an unwashed hobo I feel like the world s biggest ass for not telling him about my plans to move to MS Here s why Tuesday morning he pulled me into his office and told me that he was aware that I have been very unhappy the past several months yes I am that transparent and offered me a raise and bonuses and other myriad little enticements to perk me up And it did and I performed accordingly the majority of the week but at the same time I am eaten alive with guilt God help me I care about this man s opinion of me and he has given me so many chances he will think I am deliberately shitting on him for lack of a better term if I leave And I really really don t want that Do I tell him now Do I tell him later Do I never tell him and change all of my plans and put all my hopes and dreams for myself on hold and stay here and work at this job for the rest of my life Should I stay or should I go 

25	Only this time it was the end of my day that sucked I made my wonderful lasagna again for our potluck at work Everyone loved it We polished it off between the five of us in my department sorry Lisa We all had a good time Now let me quickly explain that Jefe has told me to keep an eye on Posh and to let him know when she does something she is not supposed to do read magazines call her boyfriend eat at her desk trim her arm hair with her scissors I have to write him a report every day and give it to him SUPPOSEDLY this was confidential and he was not to have told her where he is getting his information So Posh sees me get up go into his office and hand him my report not knowing what it is And two minutes later he calls her in his office and apparently bitches her out because she comes back in crying and when I ask her what s wrong she ignores me and when I ask her anything work related she looks right through me Which totally pissed me off So I went into Jefe s office after work and bitched him out because he had told me it would be confidential and now she s treating me like crap So he tells me that THAT pisses HIM off her acting like that and he would take care of it because he s pissed enough at her as it is Grrrrrrrrrrr This is why I don t like narcing narking on Posh He always tells her it s me watching her He claims that my reporting on and evaluating her is to teach me management skills Shee it Like he s ever going to replace her with me Satan will be climbing the Matterhorn when that happens More and more like high school every day That should be the company s motto I am planning menus for next week My Gazelle came with an eating guide and I am going to try that at my mother s request Apparently her cardiologist has told her that Atkins is not a good idea and she thinks I should do something else for her own peace of mind This is also why she will never allow me to get bypass even though I don t want that either My cousin a k a Newly Skinny Slut got the surgery and then also had to go back for plastic surgery to get rid of all of her excess skin NSS has been sick ever since and can only eat enough food to fill your palm in one sitting She keeps getting put back in the hospital for infections and shit But to be honest it s not necessarily the surgery s fault She doesn t take care of herself and make sure she s getting all of the nutrients she needs Plus according to the family she s begun to give it up to every guy who gives her a second glance which is not much different than she was in high school so I m not sure why everyone in the family is surprised by her behavior now But at the same time she s a young mother her baby is only two and newly divorced and hardly working her mother Lady Di is paying all of her bills She s acting a little crazy for someone who should be a bit more responsible And I m one to talk But anyway I m a chickenshit when it comes to surgery and hospitals so I totally would never do bypass And I get so easily tired of Atkins anyway I think I will try Tony Little s plan and if all else fails there s always Subway

25	Daily Horoscope It s time for you to take a stand but it could be a difficult thing to do Sometimes your feelings are so strong that it s easier for you to pretend that everything s ok even when it s not Take the pressure off your internal emotional build up by letting off a little steam in a socially acceptable way Tackle football or bullfighting may not work for everyone Find something physical that works for you Something physical as in breaking down at your desk and crying and shuddering so hard that someone in your office thought you might be having a seizure Cracky tends to overdramatize I will be pounding it out on the Gazelle or the antelope as Lisa calls it tonight But in all seriousness my day ended much better than it began I pulled Posh aside without throwing her out of the window and explained that I was frustrated and then my afternoon began to be better And out of the goodness of my heart actually I got trapped into it I stayed an hour late and helped Posh clean the office But I couldn t resist coming around a dark corner and yelling Look out at the top of my lungs It did my devilish little heart good to see her jump a full foot in the air Maybe tomorrow will be better

25	I found out today via urlLink the Birmingham News that a friend of mine from high school is getting married in two weeks And even though I have not spoken to this girl in almost five years I am glad for her But it made me think why have so many of my past friendships been so easily disposable The thing is I broke off contact with all but one Lisa of my high school friends back in 99 My reason for that was a fight I had with one of my friends who turned out not be such a good friend after all And because she was closer to everyone who was in our little circle of pals from high school they all went to UA together I just stopped talking to everyone so I wouldn t have to deal with this particular girl again No big loss it turned out no one ever tried to see why I stopped coming around and I am sure they heard plenty from my ex friend The bride elect I mentioned earlier had been a friend of mine since the 8th grade We had an on again off again friendship throughout high school which was on again our senior year But the funny thing was it was never really a friendship in the way a friendship should be It was always me making plans me calling her me going to see her never the other way around There was no reciprocation on her part or if there was it was half hearted at best But I liked hanging out with her and we had some good times In the back of my mind I always felt she didn t value our friendship like I did But I stuck around because I was reluctant to forget someone I had known for so long You ll stick with anything long enough if you know there s security and continuity there The last time I saw her was the summer of 99 The ex friend and I went to her house and stayed up all night watching scary movies with her boyfriend at the time who I think is the guy she is marrying same name and if he is then way to go I have good memories of times we spent together I remember us going to Tannehill on a field trip with another friend of ours and out of nowhere we just decided to climb a mountain a really really steep rocky hill probably about 40 50 feet high None of us were athletic by any stretch of the imagination We were slipping and sliding and laughing our asses off and just having fun We helped each other and all three of us made it up that damn mountain And we did it again the next year just to prove we could I remember eating lunch with her every day for four years we always had the same lunch period I remember mediating between her and another girl when they both fell for the same guy senior year I remember sharing crushes on various guys after school job horror stories and college application nightmares I remember the bad times We fought like clockwork once a year for several weeks at a time We wouldn t speak wouldn t even look at each other But we always made up and I d like to think that we finally grew up when we made it through our entire senior year without issue I m glad that she seems to have found her happiness I m jealous that I still have not found my own I m sad I don t know her now All I know about her life right now is what fits in a wedding announcement in the Sunday paper I m sorry I never kept in touch I wish I knew her now to see what she s like and to see if we would still be friends after all these years Probably not But I still wonder The thing is even if I could go back and change things I don t think I would Everything that has happened to me has happened for a reason It s changed me it s made me grow it s given me purpose I am a different person than I was five years ago And I will continue to grow and I ll be a different person when I see her at the reunion in three years I am finally starting to accept the person that I have become I am starting to like myself I am intelligent I am funny in a really goofy kinda stupid way I am creative I am unpredictable I m loud I m emotional I m bitchy I m temperamental I m thoughtful I am a mental depository of useless trivial knowledge that makes me a Jeopardy ace I m always learning and I m curious about everything some people would call that nosiness I am not afraid to state my opinion I will fight for what I want I like to take care of people I give the best head rubs in the galaxy I am potentially a GREAT human being I have a good family that loves me even though it sometimes may not feel that way I know they will be there for me if dire need ever arose I have the best friend in the entire universe who doesn t even know how great she is she s like ten of everybody else She showed me what real friendship is And I have a really decent job for now something that will provide for me and a boss who most of the time treats me like family and makes sure that I am taken care of as long as I am taking care of his company Of course there are things about myself I don t like But I am always trying and I am always working on myself Maybe I have a rose colored view of myself at this point Maybe I am just seeing what I want to see But when I catalog my good points to myself they far outweigh the bad That means I am on the right track I know myself better than anyone and I also know better than anyone else what my weak points are and how to improve them It s funny how something so innocuous as a wedding announcement can send your mind hurtling back through time to relive your memories and reevaluate yourself But it s a rainy Sunday afternoon and it s a perfect time to be reflecting on my past Now it s time to focus on my future 

25	I m hopping on my soapbox urlLink See Exhibit A And all I can think is 1 This means more interviews with Shelby and Matt Lauer on Today which are excruciating at best and reinforce all stereotypes about the slow mentality and sheer idiocy of those who reside in our fair state could they not have hired the man a speaking coach he s been on the Hill long enough to have earned one by now and I don t know anyone from around here that actually talks like he does Geez When I first found out he was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee a few years ago I thought for a moment that everyone on the Senate floor was smoking crack to allow such a thing on a side note does one actually smoke crack I need to ask Cracky on Monday Someone who sounds that damn stupid is a bad reflection on us all in my humble opinion especially when he s supposed to be representing intelligence Why can t the man give a cohesive coherent interview 2 This is a man who used to be a Democrat who switched sides ten years after first being elected to Congress he actually switched sides only ONE DAY after the Republicans took control of Congress in 94 His reason He claims the Democratic Party left him and his followers behind or some such garbage But because this state is made up of mostly Republicans he s been elected back twice since or three times maybe I ve lost count Personally I ve never quite believed his sudden conversion to Republican ideology after being a Democrat for so long and to me it stunk of a political ploy I remember talking about this in high school and being absolutely revolted by either his blatant re election strategy or his crappy timing I didn t believe him then and I don t really believe any claims of innocence now 3 Although in his defense how distasteful it just felt to type those words he IS a Southerner and therefore is blessed or cursed depends on how you look at it with the gossip gene If it s in his blood you can t really blame the man for wanting to share secrets That s why Southerners do not make good CIA operatives I just sincerely hope he doesn t turn into another Howell Heflin We don t need any more panty head mopping politicians making everyone in the country think we re even more backwards than they already do And now I ll be hopping down

25	You are the Fool card The Fool fearlessly begins the journey into the unknown To do this he does not regard the world he knows as firm and fixed He has a seemingly reckless disregard for obstacles In the Ryder Waite deck he is seen stepping off a cliff with his gaze on the sky and a rainbow is there to catch him In order to explore and expand one must disregard convention and conformity Those in the throes of convention look at the unconventional non conformist personality and think What a fool They lack the point of view to understand The Fool s actions But The Fool has roots in tradition as one who is closest to the spirit world In many tribal cultures those born with strange and unusual character traits were held in awe Shamans were people who could see visions and go on journeys that we now label hallucinations and schizophrenia Those with physical differences had experience and knowledge that the average person could not understand The Fool is God The number of the card is zero which when drawn is a perfect circle This circle represents both emptiness and infinity The Fool is not shackled by mountains and valleys or by his physical body He does not accept the appearance of cliff and air as being distinct or real Image from Mary DeLave urlLink http www marydelave com urlLink Which Tarot Card Are You brought to you by urlLink Quizilla 

25	I have always thought that the environment I work in rife as it is with drama comedy heartache anger and foolishness would make a great basis for a dramedy sitcom Case in point the following memo was passed around the office on Thursday and believe it or not this is a serious problem at my workplace ATTENTION ALL NASTY FOLKS Alright now this seems a little ridiculous to have to pass out a memo telling y all how not to be completely disgusting but Apparently some of you are wiping boogers on walls and any place else you feel like it I don t have to tell MOST of you how revolting this is If you feel the need to pick your nose instead of using a tissue and something s on your finger get a tissue wipe it on yourself EAT IT for all we care but DO NOT wipe it on the walls of the bathroom breakroom or anywhere else like a five year old would Now this doesn t apply to everyone because I know that not everyone that works here is a nasty nose pickin maggot so I apologize for subjecting you all to this issue but at least now you know that there are TACKY NASTY CLASSLESS DISGUSTING PEOPLE among us so WATCH OUT FOR THEM Management This memo was actually my fault Not through any booger picking I told Posh who moonlights as our company s janitor that I was getting sick of seeing the boogers all over the bathroom wall and there was one on the break room wall that I noticed while I was eating my lunch yesterday the boogers are up so high on the wall it s like someone had decided to flick them and try to beat their own record or something So she and Chili Dog came up with the memo and dispersed it to everyone and poor Posh had to scrape all the boogers off the wall last night which she technically should have done way before now because they had been up there for quite a while But she forgot the one in the break room and I saw it again today whilst eating my sesame chicken from China Ya oh yum By the way it may just be me but every time I eat sesame chicken I always get a little giggly and a teensy bit guilty because the stupid part of my brain will always associate sesame chicken with Big Bird on Sesame Street But then I get over it because 1 Big Bird is a puppet duh and 2 even if they did fricassee him cotton and fake feathers would not taste as good under a sesame glaze as the chicken i e dog they fry up instead Moving on Today was a lazy day No one wanted to work I have not had the best week but at least it s over now Another chapter in my life at the company down Another to be written next week Maybe one NOT so dramatic Maybe I can actually have a good week next week And maybe I can take off under my own power and sail the skies Speaking of sailing the skies my brother Nick is in Texas for a month He flew there by himself his first time on a plane ever He got an internship at some art studio that does computer animation and he ll be there for a few weeks I found out by calling my mother s cell phone this evening looking for her ring Nick Yeah Me Nick Nick Yeah Me What the hell are you doing with Mom s cell phone Nick sounding pissed I m in Texas This is long distance Call her at home click So I called my mom who was watching Jeopardy with Daddy and she laughed and explained what was going on and said she gave Nick her phone in case of an emergency Then we stayed on the phone and played along and I got Final Jeopardy right and she got it half right which is good for Mom since she doesn t know shit about Shakespeare and Dad didn t have a clue hee hee Category Shakespeare Question or Answer however you look at it Two of the four Shakespeare plays in which a ghost appears My answer What are Hamlet and Macbeth Mom s answer What are Romeo Juliet and Julius Caesar The correct answers Hamlet Macbeth Julius Caesar Richard III for the record I knew all but Richard III And of course Mr Smarty Pants got it right and he set a new one day record of 75 000 and he gets to come back in eight weeks after all the tournaments are over 38 straight days What a way to make a living He ll never have to haul manure or whatever he does 9 5 ever again Lucky bastard I am going to spend tomorrow cleaning and sprucing up the joint and then Sunday I am going over to my parents house to have some quality time with Lucy the Amazing Yapping Yorkie oh yeah and my mom and dad too All is pretty good I m just moving right along down the track Choo choo 

25	Whatever has been started over the last month can now begin to take root and become more solid This is partly about shining the light on your own accomplishments and allowing others to see what you ve done This doesn t mean that you ll need to give up the security of what you already have You will however need to find balance between your home and your professional world Yeah we ll see Had a talk with Jefe yesterday Let s just say we came to an understanding His understanding is that I am an ungrateful twit sometimes My understanding is that he is a colossal ass sometimes Now we can work in harmony And I have learned not to speak casually with Barbie about workplace ethics She told Posh I wasn t feeling appreciated and of course Posh couldn t wait to share that with Jefe who was pissed because admittedly after a lot of the stuff he s done for me over the years I should be grateful And I am But he has a way of making me feel lower than dirt sometimes It doesn t say much about my character that I keep coming back for more

25	Daily Horoscope You might be thinking about what you are really worth and I don t mean in dollars It s about valuing what you do You may be uncertain about how much value others place on your work Now something can happen to make you realize that others don t necessarily know what you really do and that they cannot properly judge your contribution What s most important now is not what others think about you it s about what you believe about yourself Talk about being a day late and a dollar short Where were the stars yesterday when I really could have used this Everyone in this state forgets how to drive when it rains It s not as though everyone really knows how to drive under ordinary circumstances anyway but when it rains it s like Oh no It s wet and cold and slick I think I ll drive 5 miles an hour in the left lane and piss everyone else off or Wow It s like a Slip n Slide Let me drive faster and swerve into other lanes careening at top speed Needless to say I did not enjoy my drive home even though I made good time It only took me about 30 minutes to get home which on 280 traffic is unusual even in nice weather I spent the day wishing for 5 00 Now I will spend the weekend wishing I could stay at home for a month and recuperate That job takes what little sanity I have and spreads it thin I think I will spend part of the day tomorrow at Books a Million I love that place Books are balm to my weary soul I must be tired That was almost profound

25	Whew It took me almost three hours to figure out what classes I want to take come fall It s not that I m wishy washy it s that every class I wanted to take conflicted time wise with another one I wanted to take and I had to compromise on a couple But I am pretty sure I am set now I m taking 5 classes so I can kind of ease my way back into things The mistake I made my freshman year was signing up for 8 classes including two required seminars and I got so overwhelmed I had to drop one of them and take it in the spring I want to make sure I can handle everything this time I m taking a required junior composition course although I only have 50 total credit hours 10 short of junior status I have enough prerequisites that they will let me in anyway and because of my sniff advanced age I will also be taking two other English classes English Lit of the 19th Century and Adolescent Children s Lit which I hope will be as fun as it sounds I am also taking the second half of Western Civ I AP ed out of the first half and College Algebra which will be my only required math class to graduate and here s hoping I actually pass it this time I took it freshman year and did not exactly fail but I might as well have seeing as how getting a D is making me have to take the damn class all over again I am praying for a C That s all I want A frickin C So save the horrors of algebra it will be a seemingly easy way to slip back into scholarly mode Here s hoping

25	I was wondering who the third would be and now we know I m so sad about Marlon Brando I loved him in A Streetcar Named Desire He was hot as a young guy Like really really hot With really really nice arms and that black black hair and that piercing stare and damn why d he let himself go Anyway I m sad First Tony Randall who I adored then Reagan who admittedly wasn t the best actor but a pretty decent Prez and now Brando I m almost as sad as I was last summer when Katharine Hepburn died Almost I don t care if anyone thinks I m sad for being sad about all these people passing away I m a huge huge classic movie fan and it s sad to see them go They just don t make movies like they used to Moving on It s been a long two days while Posh was out and now I have an inkling of how she feels when she has four people shouting questions at her all day and Jefe making demands and having to open deals and deal with the assholes that we normally get to pawn off on her It was EXHAUSTING I felt like I was being dragged in fifteen different directions for the past two days and I can t believe I am about to say this but I am so glad she is coming back on Tuesday I can t take this anymore This prick called in today and gave Blondie a hard time saying he was going to sue us for harrassment She didn t know how to handle it so she hands it to me so you know there s a smackdown coming He proceeds to tell me that he has two of our reps on tape telling him we are paying off his bills but surprise surprise when I ask to hear it it s in his office and not available for listening It turns out he works as a bill collector so he knows what we do yet he is bitching me out saying that we are harrassing him even after I pointed out that we have NEVER called him though he has called US three times in the past month so if you want to talk harrassment He then proceeds to call me well here s a transcript as best as I can remember Prick Look you fucking bitch I want your full name and position You have to give it to me It s the law Me Um I don t have to give you anything if you re being abusive to me Prick I can call you a fucking cum swallowing whore and you still have to tell me your fucking name and position Me Um okay Silence Prick So what s your name bitch Me If that works for you Prick I said what s your name Me Brandie Prick And your last name Me You don t need that I m the only Brandie that works here Prick You have to give me your last name Me Okay um Smith Prick And what is your position there Me Representative Prick Of what Me Of the company you just called Prick I asked for your position you fucking bitch Me This is not the military sir I am not required to state my name rank and serial number Prick Is Brandie Smith your real name or your alias Me My what Prick Your alias A fake name Me I don t know what you mean by that This is also not the CIA sir And so on and so forth and bladdy bladdy blah So then he tells me I work for a company of liars and then I told him I had been working there for five years and I know I have never heard someone lie to a customer but I have known many customers that don t understand plain English Then he tells me the only reason I still work there is because I can t find a better job which was funny and sometimes SEEMS true but in all honesty I could find one if I actually got up off my ass and looked I pointed out to him that he s one to talk since he works as a BILL COLLECTOR which is one step up from cockroach in most people s opinions Then he asked me how I sleep at night since I spend my life lying to customers so I answered Tylenol PM Then he asked me how I could look myself in the mirror and I told him I could see myself just fine and furthermore I could feel good knowing that what I do for a living helps people live a better life when all he does for a living is make people want to kill themselves because he badgers them to death when they can t pay their bills Nyah nyah a boo boo Finally he said I was stupid and had a low IQ and that I was a dumb shit Which is all essentially the same thing Duh So I popped off with You know sir you re not hurting my feelings no matter how hard you try You know what You seem really really unhappy do you know Jesus Christ He flipped out saying You just broke the law You can t talk about religion on the phone So I just sat there and he said really snidely That shut you up didn t it And I said No sir but if you re not saved there s no need for me to waste my time talking about it But I will pray for you And that shut HIM up for like 2 seconds and as a sidebar I do feel kinda bad for breaking out the religion talk when I m kinda not really all that into it myself but I knew it would piss him off So then he kept telling me to hang up on him because he wanted to be able to report to my supervisor that I hung up on him and I told him I would not give him the satisfaction and after 28 minutes and 52 seconds he finally gave up and hung up on me Victory dance waves arms shakes big ass I mean I was able to respond with a perfectly sweet voice in a perfectly calm manner and throw back every bit of vitriolic diatribe he was throwing off at me with a smile and a cheery tone And boy did it piss him off And the sad thing is he was at work when he was saying all this shit to me I wish I knew what company he worked for I m sure they d be mad as hell if they knew he was talking like that on company time He even asked me at one point So how many of your coworkers are standing behind you listening to your performance And I told him the truth None See we actually work at my company Teehee I told Jefe about the conversation and he laughed and said it was great He loves it when people act like dumbasses But I kinda wish I hadn t had to deal with it at all even though I was able to hold my own and defend my company and not cuss him out which is what I was dying to do I would have rather let Posh handle it after all she s used to being called a cum dumpster and shit like that another baaaaad call from a while back At least she ll be back on Monday I m tired of these crazy folks Moving forward again I went to my crackhouse a k a the Hallmark store today after work and bought myself a pretty new purse that has to be seen to be believed It s a little over the top but then so am I Lisa s in Mobile this weekend hopefully shaking off her funk and getting her grove on and will come back bright eyed and bushy tailed albeit sad that she had to leave boohoo at least you ve found someone I will be relaxing on the couch and contemplating the wisdom of Atkins this weekend Happy Fourth of July everyone

25	When Lisa starts comparing me to her ex husband it s time for me to shut up and move on The days are getting busier and school is almost completely set up just lacking a dorm room Got all excited because the comptroller told me I d be getting an almost 1000 refund from my financial aid and then realized that they had not factored in room board So I ll end up paying a couple thousand spread out over nine months I am seriously trying to figure out how I can establish residency in MS and save myself an out of state fee next year Then I really would be getting a refund Moving on I can tell you two things I know for certain in this world 1 The best way to get over your issues is to write them all out case in point the entry I previously entered here that I deleted because I no longer felt mad 2 There is nothing like a good cry to detox your system from all the bad stuff you sometimes have to hold inside But I digress I still have so much left to do including packing and fixing my car The butterflies are still there I can t stop being excited I m off to clean and then to finish my cheesy romance novel in the bathtub Sometimes I thank the Lord for Harlequin romance Sometimes I just need to get away At least in spirit if not in actuality

25	My father brother and I went to MS today to scout around I put in a couple of applications and brought a couple home I ll only have to work 20 25 hours a week and I ll probably end up at Winn Dixie Which is fine I worked there before for all of two months right before I started working at the current company My dad is happy I am going to be in school again He keeps telling me he s proud that I made the decision myself applied for everything myself etc We talked a lot about what I m going to do and family stuff and then John and I watched a movie on my dad s portable DVD player although we didn t finish it Die Another Day was pretty decent All in all it was a nice trip We buzzed campus there is a hella lot of construction going on because they are expanding but everything I remember is still there frankly I m surprised at just how much I do remember Then Dad got hungry for steak as we started back and we had to drive all the way to Tuscaloosa to find a decent one at Buddy s which is an Alabama fan s wet dream what with all the tributes to the Bear I learned that my dad drives like a grandma on the interstate which I guess is good since he hasn t gotten a ticket in years but is a shame because he s got such a hot car brand new cherry red Mustang you just try and tell me that s not a midlife crisis car I also learned today that my cousin who used to be a pilot for American Eagle is now the pilot for the Auburn University athletic division which means he flies Tommy Tuberville and his staff all over the country to wherever they need to go Even though I hate airplanes how cool is that job My fear of airplanes goes way back I ve never gotten on one and I don t plan to any time soon If that keeps me from experiencing certain things that s regrettable but my fear of the plane ride would ruin any trip I took anyway My phobia really irritates my cousin he s offered to take me up himself on my first plane ride and when I decline he gets insulted like he thinks I think he ll kill me It s not that I don t trust him But if man were meant to fly wouldn t God and or natural selection have given us wings I m just saying Anyway It s getting closer Two more weeks and then I m gone Pfwing 

25	My car would not start this morning I think it s the starter It s been giving me problems for a while but now it s just dead Lisa let me drive her car today and everyone at work called me a pimp Barbie told me to tell you your car is very much a check me out hoes kind of car I m sure she meant that in the best possible way My dad will look at it tomorrow and then I may be paying another towing bill Sigh And I can t register for my classes My freaking PIN doesn t work I had to sit on the phone at work on my lunch break for almost thirty minutes to get the damn number and I get home today and it doesn t work And because I kept trying it the system has locked me out so now I have to call tech support on Monday AND the registrar s office yet again to make sure the number is right Grrrr My parents and I are driving to MS tomorrow so I can start looking for a part time job and to see if there are any cheap but decent apartments I hope they don t want to start early but knowing my parents they ll be knocking on the door at 8AM I said bye to Foxy today It was her last day before taking off for maternity leave She s due on the 16th My day in the pool is the 17th I told her to try to hold it in until then if necessary I am going to miss her but we ll keep in touch and I ll come visit baby Elijah I m going to miss several people very much But life goes on and there s always the telephone And there are several people I won t miss much at all you hear me calling you Crackhead she didn t bother to show up ALL WEEK I can t wait to leave And I ordered a deluxe luxury foot spa from the incentives catalog at work Hopefully it will be here before I go I m just glad this week is over Finally 

25	I am no longer the black sheep of the family sorry John I like being the slightly tarnished silver child again My father is a strange funny man And I love him even though his moods are more bipolar than mine And no matter how mad he makes me I still think I got relatively lucky in the dad department He always comes through when I need him the most He is beside himself because he is so happy that I am going back to school He s almost more excited than I am He wants me to ride with him to Mississippi this weekend and look at apartments because he wants to get me one if we can find one near school that is not too expensive IF dorm room board expenses turn out to be too much I ll know tomorrow He also wants to take me around to find a part time job He and my mother are going to help me move to MS in two weeks They both keep calling me reminding me to do this and do that and make sure I take this and leave that and my mother keeps trying to get me to leave my damn Gazelle here so she can play with it because she s certain I won t have room for it so I asked her if she wants a fat daughter forever and she laid off I forgot how much my dad enjoys the whole school process He likes to discuss classes and map out a plan I think it came from his being forced to drop out of college when he was younger because he had a family to support my dad is actually very smart but that s sometimes overshadowed by his tendency to be an asshole much of the time He s not getting to do it much with my brothers Nick s been taking art classes at community college for going on four years now submitting work and waiting to get discovered John s starting this fall but only taking two classes he s trying to get his average up so he can get into Auburn John wants to coach high school football and teach history I think it s a good idea but Daddy doesn t He keeps pushing for John to go into physical therapy He wants all three of us to be better than he was not that there is anything AT ALL wrong with my parents He secretly harbors the dream that one of us kids will provide for him in his old age Plus he wants to be able to brag That is something I think I have nipped in the bud though It used to bother the shit out of me that I would visit my dad at work and people I did not know would come up to me and congratulate me on my latest achievement It was flattering I guess I just get easily embarrassed and don t like it So Daddy is under strict orders not to tell ANYONE in the family or any of his buddies that I am back in school If anyone asks where I am I got a job offer in MS I don t want any naysayers and my family is especially good at that Two weeks from today will be my last day at my job I ll have to say farewell to Jefe Posh and the rest of the zany crew most if not all of whom I will probably never see again I have a few regrets but I know this is all for the best I wasn t meant to spend my life there but I am grateful for the time I spent therein Moving forward I m thinking about pre law I d be done with law school by the time I turn 30 That s not bad It was my major before and I can double it with English God bless government aid And Stafford loans And Pell Grants And God bless midnight brainstorms without which I never would have decided that I should go back to where it all started and write a different ending this time

23	So here I sit at work Only three more hours left I guess that s not so bad It s over time so that makes it even better This online Blog idea was very clever The user interface is very easy to use I like it So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions I don t think there is I use to I use to never believe in love at first sight But just because you don t believe in something doesn t mean it s not there It s amazing how I use to think when someone would say Oh you ll know when you ve found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with I d think to myself how can that possibly be How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone Use to think it was all just movie talk hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise But I believe it now I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future I kept telling him I don t know Because well I don t He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again and I said No I don t have hopes for anything Never have It s better to have never hoped for anything then to have been let down by those false hopes But is it better to have loved and lost then to have never loved Going through the break up I began thinking it s better to have never loved But in recent events I couldn t change my mind quick enough I would rather have loved and lost The joy of being with that one person and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same is priceless Well there is quite alot there to read hehe I guess I should probably get some work done

16	Just bought a new cd by Avril Lavigne Under My Skin Being a typical Virgo will check out my starsign online and paste it here i am extremely critial about anything that concerns me And the verdict is after a year or two break Avril still rocks wow her album is amazing i liked all of the songs inside it except one he wasn t which didnt really make sense wow one talented chick here punk rock seems to be getting better and better huh However compared to her first album there is more other sounds other than she singing and sometimes her voice is covered by all the other sounds making it sound like she s scream singing or is she but overall i still think that if you guys are thinking of getting something new Avril s album is not a bad choice Being in the industry for quite some time now she seems to have matured in her thinking and thus portrays it in her lyrics there s even the last song called slipped away it was dedicated to her grandpa who passed away i think the lyrics is really meaningful and tell you she s not just another punk freak gurl devoid of loving people i guess I guess why Avril s song really turns me on not that way is because she is really truthful with the lyrics she writes and that you are able to relate her song to a part of your life be it when you are madly infactuated or have a love at first sight thingy or feeling betrayed by your other half and i guess that s cool oh yeah one last thing I didn t regret buying it 

16	hey read this at today s sunday times yes im reading something new other than those bitchy mags the topic about shallowism and the bias ness if there is such a word of the society quite a good article IT S not pretty to say that one desires beauty so Singaporeans shy away from admitting looks are important Nearly everyone 98 per cent polled in the latest Sunday Times Poll claimed to be happy with his or her looks and that looks don t matter But if given the chance to change one thing about themselves 60 per cent would grab it On the wish list a flatter stomach a slimmer figure and more toned muscles Mr Peter Lee managing consultant of an executive search firm said It s still politically incorrect to admit that looks are important because that s superficial But no matter what people like to deal with attractive people The social stigma of being seen to be over concerned about looks means that plastic surgeon Martin Huang needs to tread carefully when he meets patients at parties About 80 per cent of them ignore me and pretend that they don t know me This is why I never acknowledge patients in public especially high profile ones unless they acknowledge me first so that their privacy is protected Of the representative sample of 438 people surveyed by Singapore Press Holdings research arm 42 per cent reckon that good looking people have an easier life About 80 per cent say that being blessed with big eyes flawless skin and a toned body means that one is more likely to nail a job than a plain Jane or average Joe Some 60 per cent think good looks are important in getting a promotion Human resource specia lists agree Mr Lim Kian Kok of Mercer Human Resource Consulting said The reality is that we ll be biased towards attractive looking people At job interviews first impressions always count Human resource manager Esther Chia of recruitment agency Kelly Services said Good looks give one a foot in the door Social psychologists have found that interviewers decide within 15 seconds if someone is right for a job Another study has found that when identical resumes are presented with different photographs the unattractive ones are less likely to be shortlisted The companies interviewed said that if they discriminate by looks it has to do with the positions Cosmoprof which manages spas such as those in Fullerton and Goodwood Park hotels will not hire anyone who is overweight or has a bad complexion as a guest relations officer Its manager Ms Angie Soon said They have the responsibility of greeting our guests and thus are required to look attractive Even firms that are not in such beauty conscious businesses admit that all else being equal they would choose a more attractive candidate over a plainer one Mr Alick Chia managing director of SKF Logistics Services Asia said Human instinct would lead us to pick the better looking one Looks may also translate into more confidence Polytechnic graduate Susan Cheong 22 knows what this cost her She had six interviews in the two months after she graduated but was never once shortlisted though her peers found work quickly She said frankly I m obese and not pretty People in the human resource industry tell me I need to lose weight if I want to work in the corporate field Now an administrator with a non profit organisation she said When I look at job ads I automatically rule out those that want pleasant looking people It means young and pretty Psychiatrist Lionel Lim said he sees four or five patients a year who suffer from depression or anxiety because they were bypassed for jobs or promotions owing to their looks Some choose plastic surgery Dr Huang said the number of clients who seek his help before going for job interviews has doubled in the last two to three years Firms insist that though looks may play a role what ultimately counts are attitude and capability This is good news for Miss Cheong who is determined to fight on her own terms She said I believe my attitude will pull me through If you ask me i feel that how you look does not stop me from befriending you but for me i feel obligated to look good or the best of my ability to keep up with my horrendous appearance its just that the society is shallow nowadays and it will be getting worse in time to come i guess Many peeps think that if you are good looking then you are a really shallow and a proud person Not true Take me for example Hahah just kidding No lah haha really kidding im jus the average joe lah but i do know of people who are good looking and yet are very nice people just that they have more self confidence and thus that is what people nowadays are looking for right hope it makes sense I have friends who are modelling type and they are quite nice people really But there are also quite a number of people who are are blessed with good looks but have a proud and shitty attitude so i guess you would have to know the person before you comment then and that s what i always do Im just that teenage boy with hair that NEVER does what i say with oily face that is well oily and although i am not fat i FEEL fat Then if thats the case in the first place i should not have lost weight and take up a strict exercise regiment beacuse i still feel fat before and after i lose weight I spoke to my mum about it about my mental problem bout being fat and she said i am retarded Hahaha kidding la she said i am already skinny enough Since when did anyone say that to me and if i continue to go on the strict routine i will become underweight i told her if it is even possible for me to be underweight that is then i will see how So now she s like forcing me to eat lots gosh the last thing i ever need Btw i just realised that i can go without food for the whole day without feeling hungry at all wow amazing right it so happened that yesterday i had a whole day filled with activities from the time i woke up till night so i didnt really eat until like seven and then i was still not hungry then even after running 2km but i forced myself to eat for fear that i would die from malnutrition or what hahah will try it again tomorrow just drink my soya bean and everything will be alright will be running bedok reservoir tomorrow afternoon with my dear friend Karin Cant wait to run love the scenery there man and the eye candys even more K la hav to go to school tmr go zzz now

16	Here was one of the interesting blogs which i read just now hope it inspires you to do anything hey by the way peeps for those who reads my blog religiously hey dont hide i know one okay or for those who REALLY have nothing better to do right just leave comments about my blog alright thanks Title Love like a bus When the bus come you look at it and you said to yourself eeee so full cannot sit down one So you said to yourself I ll wait for the next one so you let the bus go and waited for the second bus Then the second bus came you looked at it and you said eeee this bus so old surely very uncomfortable one So you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus After a while another bus came It s not crowded and not old but you said eeee no air con one and the weather is so warm better wait for the next one so again you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus Then the sky started to get dark as it is getting late You panicked and jump on to the next on coming bus It is not until much later that you found out that you had boarded on to the wrong bus So you wasted your time and money waiting for what you want Even if an aircon bus came can you ensure that th e aircon bus won t break down or will the aircon be too cold for you So people want to make sure that what you want is not wrong But it wouldn t hurt to give other people a chance right If you found that the bus doesn t suit you just press the red button and get off the bus But wait I am sure all of you have this experience before You saw a bus is coming the bus you want of course you flagged it and the driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you and zoomed pass you The bottom line of being loved is like waiting for a bus and whether you want to get on the bus and give the bus a chance depends totally on you and walking alone is just like being out of love Remember to always say what you mean If you love someone tell Don t be afraid to express yourself Reach out and tell someone what he or she means to you Because when you decide that it is the right time it might be too late Seize the day Never have regrets And most importantly stay close to your friends and family for they have helped make you the person that you are today Friendship is never an accident It is always the result of high intentions sincere effort intelligent direction and skillful execution It represents the wise choice of many alternatives And remember Keep Smiling coz Of All Things You Wear Your Smile Is As love returns to me The only way to find LOVE isn t finding the perfect person but by loving the imperfect person perfectly True LOVE doesn t have a happy ending it simply doesn t end 

16	When you d cry i d wipe away all of your tears when you d scream i d fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me Err no prizes for guessing whats the title of this song in case you dont know it s My Immortal by Evanessance Dedicated to no one in particular jus had this song running over and over again my head Being single its perfectly normal to be thinking of all these kinds of stupid things hahah its kind of hard to like someone but not let the person know huh but being me as usual i ll just wait and see how things go never making the first move yet quietly dropping hints to be picked up Yet i know it may be just my puberty induced hormones creating infactuastic love commotion in my life to make it more interesting but i ll still wait for a while more i guess a little while more Today was tiring Skool started again for the June Hols and it dosen t end till the second last week of the hols like i said what holidays I seriously think the skool has some issues What if we study too much and just before the O s we become mentally retarded would they be happy then Then my future will be gone haha but seriously O level year is no life man but looking far ahead i ACTUALLY needed the extra lessons wow i cant believe im saying this if i want my distinctions so that s the bottom line No complaining anymore But i have to tell you the teachers that are teaching me are great I mean how can you find a group of approachable and down to earth teachers in a bundle teachers like Miss Lee Wendy Cindy it goes on so i guess thats my good fortune and i have to make good use of it Wendy Loi came up to me today while ordering food She actually told me it is possible for me to get a distinction Checking if she may have been drunk or may have mixed my identity with some first express class student with thick glasses holding a thick book wherever he goes i realised that she was looking me straight in the eye I was like oh okay cool i can actually get a distinction if i work at it that is I never realise that she thought i had potential Therefore this spurs me to do better in my POA hahah yeah thats about it for today then boring life i have here Sign out 

16	Sherk 2 was the movie that i wont want to watch again anywhere and i will stop watching kiddy movies for a long time Firstly i have to tell you that it was not to my liking but however the computer animation was great it looked realistic and really good but the story plot was boring and the movie tried very hard to make people laugh and i hardly ever did except from the part where the mouse fell into the hole while trying to save the captives But anyway it s supposed to make people laugh and it is a kiddy show so i should have lowered my expectations haha oh well its a good thing that i didnt pay for it huh its a good thing that i watched with my mum will be watching Day After Tomorrow again later this week its really good oh yeah you guys have got to watch Harry Potter 3 coming on june 6 if you dont know and Mean Girls showing now okay will write more when im free then Shrek 2 Movie rating 55 pros the animation was fantasic great cast cons shitty story plot corny jokes nonsense ending 

16	yea just came back from school and had my prelim orals i got the highest in the class by far so im actually quite happy with it i guess anyway im not competing with anyone for my prelims or my O s yeah anyway going back to the show basically this show is about some currents in the sea reversing and causing ice age in basic layman terms not using climate jargons that the show used so much When they were explaining why there was a climate shift i was like huh but when the show continues you ll roughly understand what the hell they are talking about so no worries there The show was thrilling and suspenseful so not much boring dialogue more on the action and people running and screaming which is what i like best in movies im no sadist There was one part where the wolves were looking for food and they jumped out of the room and nearly hit one of the actors have yet to find out his name and that really got me I actually shouted hahha sorry annabelle haha erm and another part was the freezing of the temp and there were like running here and there that was cool too overall the movie was superb and i m watching it with my mum again later tonight i think can t wait so if you re still thinking of watching it let yours truly the movie guru tell you catch it now Movie Grade 85 pros The SFX special effects are great the chaos even better cons The show should be more realistic man Five or Six hurricanes destroying Downtown Los Angeles Plus the one erasing the sign HOLLYWOOD give me a break lah and the SFX usuage is really obvious so minus points for that Who should watch sadistic people disaster inclined people Psychos people looking for eye candy actors Who should not watch people who screams when there are exciting scenes people who cant shut up people who do not know anything about global warming 

16	One word Wow It was incredible The Special Effects was amazing an awesome show well anyway i went with the school to watch it yesterday The trailers for the show has been going on for months so naturally i was looking forward to it The seating arrangement was cool i was sitting with my two great friends Annabelle on my left and Joel on my right The show actually starts off with a global warming conference in India and we all know that that was when India started snowing meaning to say that the climate shift was already beginning oh shit okay i have to rush to school for my orals i ll continue in part 2 peace out 

16	Hey wow it s been awhile since i last wrote anything here perhaps my desire to keep an online diary is waning away wahaha oh well i have better things to do anyway the first week of school was hell i had to wake up dead early brave the chilly coldness of the morning air and nearly killing myself in the process of after showers change into my horrible uniform and look neat and clean to go to school which i must say when i reach the school i am already sweating like a bloody pig and no i don t feel NEAT and or CLEAN anymore What a life err enough about that already have to get used to the bloody routine and trying to continue my studies again so that s about it i guess Gab s birthday party Sentosa is on Sunday and i have not got her anything yet have to make arrangements with Joel and Belle to see if they are interested in sharing hehe I have a feeling that i m gonna have a great time this sunday during the party hope i will not be disappointed most unlikely though Oh and the Community run is that day too wow after weeks of practice i am finally running the 5KM run at East Coast hope everyone comes prepared and my foot dosent give me problems have to wait and see i think i have to try another method of writing into this blogie oherwise i will get bored of writing in and stop altogether hmmm am thinking about it yeah so that s about it for me im not a enthusiastic writer but a very lazy boy hahaha okay till next time soon i hope PS Have to go for the CHIJ Fest on Saturday at CHIJMES with Glenna okay noted PS 2 My chinese O levels Listening is on Sat so fast 

24	I feel it in the water the crystal vibrations of my mother s beating heart Chihiro chan she says to me Why have you forgotten us Why do you block us out from your mind In each cherry blossom I see the ghost of her sad dark eyes coming alive with a moment of recognition My daughter my daughter she sighs with the wind and I turn away I am not hers I haven t been hers for so long now I am the daughter of the Tameha okiya now the beloved first daughter of Gion Kyoto holds me at night now closely but not too familiarly 

24	I was five years old when I last saw my parents Their faces are no longer with me The passage of time means that they are but blurred shadows now dancing in the edges of my sight My father My mother Lost to me When I was a little girl they called me Chihiro chan I was their youngest their miracle My mother was an old woman I m told I don t remember her age I don t remember I have a sudden attack of doubt Perhaps it is wrong of me to be speaking out so Perhaps I should retreat back into the Flower and Willow world and keep my silence But my world now is dying what is there to lose by sharing my life When I am gone this will be the only part of me to live on 

24	Hello This site is for you to read my short stories They are all written by me I hope you like them 

24	It has been such an annoying day today I woke up this morning in pain and knew I couldn t make it into work I was really annoyed as I desperately feel ready to return now and I m actually missing my job I miss my pupils too Anyhow I made a doctors appointment and after an hour of waiting he saw me He phoned the hospital to find out my test results but they hadn t been sent for analysis while I was there er what s the point in doing them then They now no longer exist so my diagnosis whilst being likely of a kidney infection is not definite My doctor thinks it could also be problems with my spine that is causing me pain but again he s not sure It s really reassuring isn t it when you re in pain and no one really knows why What he was fairly sure of was that I had been prescribed with too strong a medication which if I did have a kidney infection would have cleared it up However it s also likely that in turn that medication is causing me the pain I m currently in think of 2 common conditions women suffer from then add to that that the doctor said on examination that it s the worse case he s ever seen and you get the picture A side effect of these antibiotics apparantly Considering that the doctors at the hospital knew that I have a history of these complaints you d think that they would have prescribed me something milder or at least warn me in advance So there we have it Nobody knows for sure what s giving me this pain the medication has made it worse there s a lot of guess work going on and nobody s entirely convinced how to make the pain stop although my Doctor thinks stopping the antibiotics will make a positive difference Filling out my sick note is going to be fun As a diagnosis of Kidney infection was given my Dr thinks we should work on the assumption that that s what I had especially as the antibiotics did make a bit of a difference Personally I m not too bothered on knowing the medical name but I would certainly feel a lot happier if they could tell me the pain will stop Doesn t the medical profession fill you with confidence I m going to lie down now with a couple of painkillers and a hot water bottle and hopefully the pain will soon subside 

24	Still off work but planning to go back tomorrow as being home alone is actually giving me rage and making me feel quite down in the dumps Thankfully it seems that I don t have Norwalk at all I phoned the doctor and he said that I didn t have enough of the symptoms What I do have the symptoms of however is someone who has recently had several different dyes and medications injected into her So it s just a side effect of those tests they did on me Phew Although to be honest I do feel a lot better today It s still uncomfortable to breathe in too deeply but I should be ok soon I never thought I d say that I missed work but there we go Bronte was a little too rough with her playing today and clamped her teeth on either side of my finger It didn t hurt in the slightest she literally wrapped her whole jaw around it and I could feel her teeth meet on the other side but she s never done that before I think she was getting too excited Just typing up some worksheets to help my year 9 s with their SATs revision I m not terribly hopeful about that class but their attitude is largely to do with it Anyway I d better press on 

24	Ooooh I never should have discharged myself from hospital The pain in my stomach is just as bad well I tell a lie this morning it was ok but last night agony I feel would be an apt word I m off again today and will be tomorrow too though I m determined to go back in on Friday That s the horrible thing about being off sick the longer you re off the more difficult it is to go back in Plus the knowledge that i ve missed out on the last few pre SATs lessons with my Year 9s has upset me a lot But what can I do I think I have caught the Norwalk virus According to the news yesterday there was an outbreak in the hospital over the weekend whilst I was there In terms of my health there is really nothing to worry about It s basically a stomach bug which is certainly making things interesting But it s a big problem at the hospital as it means nursing staff are absent and obviously it s quite unpleasant if you ve elderly or already very ill At any rate I won t be allowed back while I ve got it The irony is I was joking to Si when I went there that I would catch it I didn t realise there had actually been another outbreak So yeah I ve been taking it easy Si almost had to physically restrain me to stop me from doing the housework I ve been writing more of my rat stories which has been fun I ve had some really good ideas Reading them to my Year 7 s has certainly helped me as I now know what sort of things they responded best to The character of Dervel got the best response particularly when he says something stupid or completely irrelevent His line of I wanted to be an assassin has achieved cult status almost overnight I think what makes that line particularly funny is that he is such a hopeless clumsy stupid dozy little thing I m very pleased with the characterisation of the rats they seem to have caught my class s imagination Snitch Stitch the evil despot genius of the story is one of my own personal favourites and I m enjoying developing her character I ve just written a story where she breaks into a school classroom takes over the class and leads the students in a revolt against the teachers Makes me chuckle I read this in the Mirror this morning and it made me laugh so i thought I d include it here BOOB CASH BID NIPPED IN THE BUD A busty shopper tried to sue mall chiefs after her boobs got trapped in a revolving door The cheeky bid was among the failed claims revealed yesterday by bosses at Manchester s trafford centre One chancer demanded compensation for swollen ankles blaming lack of carpets in the centre Another wanted clothes after spilling nail varnish on hers while sitting on a mall bench to apply it And a mum tried to sue for new glasses after her child s coin rebounded off the fountain into her specs Doesn t it amaze you People really astonish me sometimes the innate ability to be sooo mind numbingly stupid and greedy has led to such a rise in the compensation culture that common sense seems to have all but deserted the world This whole blame someone else for anything that happens attitude is ruining the world It is no more evident anywhere than in school Aaaargh Need to compose myself or I ll get rage and then I ll sue the newspapers for exposing me to such maddening stories that my brain implodes Oh some good news got accepted by a very good job agency in London that has been highly recommended to me so that s an excellent step 

24	Well she lives despite the best efforts of her doctors Yes I m back under my new domain name as the other one disappeared Now it s only a question of letting you all know the new address and bingo Bob s your uncle Weeeeell I m off work again which is beginning to annoy even me The reason this time is because I ve just spent a rather tedious and painful few days in hoptipal being prodded poked and generally examined by doctors So while I was out having fun what were you doing I ll try to deal with this chronologically On Friday night I had bad stomach pains they got steadily worse and I was very uncomfortable Not much fun for me I was quite worried as on Saturday I went to Newton Abbot for my falconry experience and I was worried I would miss it Well on that morning I decided to go anyway I d been looking forward to it for such a long time Me and Si caught the train to Newton Abbot then got a taxi to the garden centre where the event was to be held It was a gorgeous day the sun was shining and everything looked so beautiul The garden centre also was very nice There s something about spending a day in a garden centre that makes you really feel like you re an adult Despite the fact I have no garden to speak of we nearly bought a whole heap of plants Luckily I resisted The Falconry centre was charming There were approx 42 birds and sadly security was a bit good so I couldn t run off with any of them This in itself was a shame as I was quite taken by the Kestrels I was surprised at how butterfly like they were in their movements Of course i do want a falcon but they look kinda difficult so I might one day start with a barn owl Anyhow the experience lasted about 3 hours I got to fly a very talkative Barn Owl who was chatting to me the whole time a tawny owl I want I want another barnie and a harris hawk The Harris Hawk was a baby and not a good flier He got frightened and ended up falling on the floor and crying Then he got tangled up in a tree what a fusser Couldn t help but laugh I also had the experience of an Eagle owl flying into me it missed my glove and landed on my arm Ouch Now and Eagle owl is very very big hence the name My arm is very little My arm is now bruised BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT Now when I got back my nether regions were still hurting then I noticed blood in my water I phoned NHS direct who told me to ring the out of hours doctor I did so and went to see him on Sunday morning After a rather uncomfortable examination he admitted me straight to hospital to my very great surprise and Si got to push me around on a wheelchair I was taken to a ward in SAU surgical assessment unit as they thought it might be appendicitus It wasn t thankfully Then I was subjected to lots and lots of tests including x rays and given some painkillers then I was pretty much left alone Si stayed with me a lot but eventually we were told I was going to be kept in overnight This did not make me very happy I was distraught when Si went home and had an ok night attempting to sleep with a big needle in one arm At about midnight a Scots bloke was brought in and I kept hearing him shout Narse Narse which confused the hell out of me until I realised that he was calling the nurse The next day even less attention was being paid to me I didn t know what was wrong with me and I was lonely and bored Scots guy was replaced with scary crusty old guy who kept shouting at the nurses making unpleasant noises in his throat and kept messing himself i did feel sorry for him a lot he got told of by the nurses for shouting at them when it was clear that he only shouted because he was deaf and in a lot of pain Even his own family seemed to treat him as a burden But it wasn t very nice I was allowed to eat by about midday about 40 hours after I d last eaten and they finally decided I d probably had a kidney stone and passed it and that had caused a painful kidney and bladder infection which had also affected my tubes They put my on antibiotics and left me to it By the evening I was straining at the bit to get home When the doctor said I would have to stay in another day I nearly had a fit No no no no no no I made him let me go home by promising I d come back if the pain got worse and technically perhaps I should have stayed in a bit longer the pain hadn t cleared up as much as I implied it had But I was feeling very unwell from just being in the hospital and was desperate to get home to my home comforts Besides what s the point in staying in hospital when the only thing being done is that I take one tablet three times a day Well I m happy to be home now but also looking forward to returning to work very much Hopefully I ll be back on Friday 

24	Hi change of address for me 

24	And the road goes ever on and on Things are getting progressively better although I can t believe there s still a week left at work before the holiday I ve been thinking about holidays in a sense I have been spoiled by having so many breaks and I don t know how I ll manage when I don t have so many Ha Poor me But I strongly suspect that having reclaimed my evenings and weekends I won t need so many holidays to recover from term time The great news is that Marcelle got my job yesterday I m am thrilled to bits for her she deserves it It s wonderful to know that she finally has a well deserved permanent job So reassuring But it s a very final thing for me It s sad to think that the department will go on without me we ve been such a team for the past 2 years and I m abandoning it Dammit I m fed up of being tired all of the time My quest to stop drinking caffeine has definitely contributed to this though I just have to stick with it Three more jobs to apply for next week so that as definitely lifted my spirits Now I will write a lesson for A level 

24	Admittedly a better day today although it could hardly be getting any worse I was so exhausted I could barely function so am about to zonk out on the sofa But I killed any nastiness with serenity and kindness which threw the pupils of guard and they were nice to me as a result Which is good 

24	Another crap day Seriously tempted to not bother going in tomorrow although I probably will Keep hoping I ll catch the flu or something so I can stay at home but regardless it ll still look poor on my job references and I m having a difficult enough time as it is Sigh Today s hot discussion in my Year Nine class was whether I had a large vagina or not Can you believe it It s an absolute disgrace I m so knackered that I can t even be good humoured about it it really upset me that they talked about me in such a crass and unkind way Too tired and defeated to protest or do anything much Going back to the doctors tomorrow 

24	I m feeling quite nervy and panicked lately It feels like there s so much to do and just not enough time I have so many things I want to do but I never have time to do them Drawing reading socialising embroidery writing I have about 5 books and 3 short stories I want to write It is making me feel extremely frustrated and panicky I know this is largely because of my teaching i e I can never do much at the weekend or relax because I know I have a lot of planning and marking to do So glad I m leaving but now the transition time is starting and everything is so unsure Can t seem to keep still On Friday I went into town and a starling flew onto my shoulder I don t know who was more shocked it or me It sat on my shoulders for a few seconds staring at me then it began to squawk It looked very annoyed After a few minutes it flew away Daft thing 

24	Yawn it s quite early in the morning I m not saying that it s ridiculously early but considering that it s the weekend it s earlier than I care to be up For the last couple of days I have been waking extremely early it isn t fair it s the weekend I managed to change my printer ink yesterday and the new one is working to an extent although it s a little pale and for some reason printing takes longer than it used to It will probably settle out soon I m going to go back to bed now and have a bit more of a sleep 

24	Just a quick post before I run into town to do battle with WHSmiths and try to get them to replace my printer cartridge for free ink won t come out any more I have to disguise the fact that it s been lying around the house for a couple of months but that s not the point it didn t work before then anyway Going to go for a drink with Si when he finishes work Feel very tired but quite content at the moment Nice weekend coming up and I ve just had a good day at work All is good with the world 

24	You know I was genuinely excited this morning to wake up at 6am to find that the first series of the Animals of Farthing Wood was on tv I felt about 13 again And it was the exciting episode where fox is swept away by debris Thrilling The question is do I want to wake up early again tomorrow morning More shock at the news of my departure today I do feel very sad at the thought of leaving but relieved also It feels like it s 3am and I m tired and I can t go to sleep for a few hours but when I do it will be the best sleep ever I was thrilled to just receive an email from TFPL agency asking if I wanted to be put forward for a job It looks like a good job too the only problem is that it s temporary If there s a possibility it might lead to something permanent I d go for it I m torn between going for it anyway because I as yet don t have a job or holding on and waiting Does look like a cool job though I ve gone all day just drinking water I m ever so proud of myself I am now deliberately leaving my purse at home so I m not tempted to nip to the shop to get a bottle of coke Dammit I will beat my caffeine addiction this time I can t let it beat me Ugh stiff neck Might go and bake some more Anzacs now Last night s batch were yummy but a bit burnt but then again the recipe was new 

24	Oh and I got into those two agencies by the way And I have been pain free for two days Hurrah 

24	Well hello there again It s a rainy Tuesday afternoon and I m feeling more than a little braindead after yesterday s incredibly long day We got back at about 9pm but bearing in mind that I hadn t actually been asleep before then I was aching all over covered in bruises and deliriously tired Thankfully a good nights sleep seems to have put paid to all that although this morning I was doing my very best zombie impression A good day at work My classes except my lower year sevens were really well behaved Bizarrely my year 9 s responded very well to the classical music I played them I want them to write a story in response to O Fortuna They really enjoyed it I guess they never really have the opportunity to listen to it at home My year 7 s though were evil Not my good group of girls they re always nice but the rest of them were pains I made one girl cry by shouting at her of which I am not proud and also made another girl clean the whole classroom after she had been messing about which I am proud of One lad said to me Miss would you ever throw a blackboard rubber at me I replied of course not When he asked why I thought I d play Miss Nice Teacher and said Because if it hit you it might hurt you and that would upset me He thought for a second and then added and I d sue you Nice Incidentally he s one of the worse behaved kids in the class It s always the badly behaved ones who bandy around veiled threats of I ll sue you if you so much as say anything to get them to calm down Funny that After school my two writer students came to see me Dan has written an excellent short story which I fully expect to see published one day Considering he s 15 he is very talented I like mentoring those two It feels like I m passing on my few remaining pearls of wisdom 

24	Hmm Blogger has been busy making some changes and I m really confused I don t know how it is at your end dear reader but I feel a little on the lost side At the moment it s 1 20am on a Sunday night What the hell am I doing up this late I hear you ask Well I could ask myself the same question It s a good question All I want to do now is sleep But at 3 45am Si and I are catching a bus to London to have a few agency interviews and I just know that if I go to sleep now I am unlikely to wake up in time So instead I will sleep on the bus Dear God I hope I can sleep on the bus We plan to arrive early so we can get a decent seat I m kinda banking on the fact that there won t be many lunatics like us who are contemplating travel this early in the morning I had so many plans of things to do to keep me awake but now they all seem to be dissolving I think I ll have a bath Well a shower might be better as there s less chance of me drowning in a shower God I m getting old In my pre teacher days I would have thought nothing of staying awake til the wee hours In fact going to bed at 2am was the norm Even quite recently well a year ago I could happily stay awake til at least 1am and not even feel tired Now I m just about ready to pass out Think a cigarette and a caffeinated drink might be in order now 

24	I am at home in the afternoon again Makes me so mad Today my pain was very bad so I taught my lessons at work and then came home at lunchtime I had no lessons this afternoon and I will go to work as normal tomorrow but I will not over exert myself Well my return to work hasn t been all that bad you know Apart from the incident of the vile student with a vendetta against me which I feel has set my recovery back a little as I was beginning to be on the mend I ve quite enjoyed a lot of it My lower set year 10s and my year 9s were ugh soul destroying but the rest has been ok VM in my tutor group has even asked me to bring back my rat story book so she can read it herself This is such a big thing for her she is so painfully shy it s without a doubt the most she s ever said to me in the 2 years I ve been her teacher It surely makes the heart swell The one sad thing is that the news of my imminent departure is slowly seeping around the school Two of my favourite pupils overheard the receptionists talking about it and boy are these girls not happy with me They are devestated Another year 8 girl asked me about it today I m not sure quite what to do now I didn t really want to break it to anyone before I went Oh well I m going to go and have a bath now 

24	Assaulted three times by the same pupil 2 out of 20 a level student handing in their homework and a class room filled with maniacs Yep the British education system folks 

24	Much as I have wanted to return to work having been off sick for so long I now find myself very very anxious at the thought of returning I ve just spent a couple of hours planning my A level lessons and I m about to mark some homework and do the rest of my planning and about a thousand things are running through my head Must remember to do this must remember to speak to so and so about this what s waiting for me in my pigeon hole what stuff do I have to prioritise I must admit that it makes me feel quite sick I m just about to email those two job agencies with regards to my interview next Monday The thought that this teaching life will soon be behind me is virtually all that keeps me going although I d feel a whole lot easier about it if I had a job 

24	Good God I m famished Think it s time to turn on the oven and cook up some ultra fattening ciabatta bread Well I got home from Exeter about 2 hours ago I think the journeying really took it out of me i was very pained on the way home and just got in a taxi from the bus station to take me straight home Si went to his dad s to email his cv to a few people I m exhausted now but have taken some painkillers too Ken Dodd was very funny Me Si mum and nan went to see him perform in Torquay last night He was really very good but I couldn t laugh too much because it hurt His show went on for so long It was 2 and a half hours before the interval We d heard that the show would go on until about 1am but none of us could stand sitting there for so long and I was in agony so we went home It was already about 10 30pm by this point The drive home was a bit scary There was so much mist and fog that at times I was a little anxious shall we say no disrespect to mum s driving skills Those winding leaf covered roads I could well imagine that at any time we might drive out of the mist and find ourselves in 1952 like Brigadoon Si and I spent all too short a time with the family before coming back today We mooched around Exeketer for a few hours and Si had to use all of his skills to prevent me from buying an army of mice sooo cute and scruffy I doubt Dervel would have appreciated the competition anyway Spoilsport I did however buy a skirt from monsoon which now means I have a whole ensemble Hurrah 

24	Today has been a very sweet settled day Relaxing Carol my boss said some very nice things and we laughed together She is a very friendly boss to have and very approachable She said that she would have to put up a barrier to stop me leaving and that the school would hold me hostage I was glad to reassure her that I was devestated to go which despite some decidely shaking moments I will be in my heart I ve enjoyed a lot of my time with the school and severel times a day I m told by a student that they will miss me Today I have had a pretty day one of those days where you glide through life on a cloud of beauty and rose water receiving compliments left and right with the graceful air of a fairytale princess These days don t happen often enough but when they do it s quite nice Did make one of my students go flustered though I m too beautiful Tonight I will do no homework and no housework Instead I will write out a few job applications and I will write some of my book It is so much what I want to do in life 

24	Well the news is that I didn t get the job and yes I am a little glum about it but not totally defeated Just very very tired 

24	Well still no news on the job front and my classes were really annoying today so I don t really feel like writing much I think I d better search for more jobs instead 

24	Well my back is finally beginning to feel better The osteopath did some crunching and some acupuncture and it hurt like hell immediately after although strangely not at the time But over the weekend the pain has definitely been easing off so that s good My neck is stiff now though so I won t spend much time on the computer As it is I have some exam papers to mark anyway 

24	I have discovered Krispey Kremes donuts and the lord proclaimed they are GOOD I found them in Harrods yesterday when I popped in to see if I could buy any of those sausages from Jimmy s Farm unlikely as I couldn t remember his name and bought a box for me and Si to share They disappeared quickly Well my interview yesterday I can honestly say I don t know how it went which probably means it didn t go all that well Let s face it if you re not coming out of an interview filled with confidence it s unlikely you got the job The first bit went well when I was telling them about my skills and qualifications They seemed impressed and I even made them laugh a few times Then when it came to job specific skills they started asking me such basic questions that I was a little gob smacked I m sure there were lots of awkward silences as my brain desperately asked itself is this a trick question I probably came across as a complete moron I think I did ok on the skills test though All I can do now is wait I should know by next week I also have to finish my on line application form for the market researchers job but I can t remember the web address so I ll have to search for that one Other than that I popped into the British museum for an hour and saw the costumes used in the film Troy they were cool I also visited my houses of worship Monsoon and Lush They symbolize cool London living to me I played a few rounds of my least favourite game tube hopping where you get on a tube then off at the next stop then realise you got off at the wrong stop and wait for the next one The train ride home was ok although I didn t get back til gone midnight Having said that I wasn t very tired See I can cope with the London lifestyle Today was a good day at work Everyone seems so relaxed and happy I ve found the kids to be very pleasant company I think I ll miss them more than I thought I know they will miss me Today was also the lesson I d been planning with Carol She came in and gave a lovely speech about how great the class was questioned them about their recent work and they did me proud Then she revealed she was wearing my Snitch for President t shirt which got a big cheer Then we handed out bars of chocolate and awards to the students I gave out the fimo rats I d made some students They were incredibly touched It was very heart warming Right I have to go back to the osteopath now and not a minute too soon 

24	Tomorrow is the day of my big interview and suddenly I m very nervous I ve just printed off a load of history for the company and today I have been refreshing my memory with regards to Powerpoint and Excel I am now convinced I am not going to get this job Ugh and an early start tomorrow Wish I already had a job A nice day at work today The students were very well behaved and there was a lot of joking and courtesy Admittedly a boy also set fire to a girl s hair this afternoon my school really is unbelievable The sad thing is that this incident failed to shock me Well I am going to do a little marking then attempt to relax I want to be nice and refreshed tomorrow I hope I get this job Wish me luck 

24	My hair has looked good all day today I styled it curly this morning before work which means I m now knackered as I was up an hour before schedule but it s looked lovely and natural and tidy I hate it when curly hair is brittle with hairspray Ok day at work today although quite exhausting and the less said about my bottom set year 7 s the better Just been exhausted and back achy So much I wanted to record on here but when it comes to it I m just too tired to post too long a message This reminds me why I am quitting my job Had a really rough night last night I developed a migraine at about 6pm and painkillers weren t touching it It got progressively worse and made my brain go a bit funny I started seeing things and hearing things and went on a bit of a looper convinced something was trying to get at me Seem to recall trying to attack my bed at one point but the damn thing had it coming I remember crying for at least an hour and the flowers that Si bought me made me cry even harder as I thought they were moving across the sideboard and it frightened me I have decided to put this episode down to exhaustion and migraine and not the mental disorder which it probably is 

24	Well I bit the bullet and got my hair cut I must say that I love it very much it s a fashionable style and it looks great when it s straightened However as I discovered this morning before work it s a pig to straighten Luckily I still managed to get it looking good and I had many many compliments at work today Which was nice I saw the osteopath this afternoon I have to go back on Friday He says my ligaments are very inflamed which is effectively making my spine stick together Luckily it s unlikely to be a long term condition and it can be treated He s surprised I put up with it for so long So am I Unfortunately I had to have a pin stuck in my bottom for him to come to this conclusion Have some school work to do and some emails to write so will sign off now G night 

24	Hurrah it s that weekend feeling coupled with that bad back feeling which has made me lie on my desk at work today mush to the amusement of my classes My back was much better this morning but now it s aching with the pressure of a long day behind it Today having said that was quite good Again it wasn t what you d call challenging I m beginning to like Fridays a lot more now that year 11 are no longer with us My year 9 s were ace this afternoon apparantly the supply teacher they had while i was off sick was an absolute bastard He made them work Shock horror But he shouted at them quite a lot made several cry refused to let them use dictionaries and told a dyslexic student to have a guess at a word she wanted help with Suffice to say they realised how lucky they were to have me as their teacher and they were very good worked well and made me promise not to be ill again until the end of term A promise I m very happy to try and keep as I hate taking time off work when I feel I shouldn t Well I m going to attempt to clean the flat now as mum and Alex are popping in tomorrow before we go back to their house for the weekend dammit now I ve spoiled the illusion my flat isn t always tidy I m having a bridesmaid dress fitting tommorrow and I m paying off a huge hunk of my wedding dress too and I m having my hair cut in the mrning I m in two minds about this Part of me wants an image change Plus my hair needs to be shorter so that I can style it nicely for Anna s wedding and I have lots of split ends and it s so difficult to manage and I want it to look stylish for my job interview and it rarely looks good these days It tangles easily and I have no time to spend on it But I like having long hair It suits me But then my hair hasn t looked great for ages But I want it long for my wedding But my long hair looks fab in those photos i had taken last year God how vacuous am I 

24	Well I have some more excellent news I have another job interview this time with a company I really want to work for Naturally this has made me very happy Even better is that the office is across the road from the British museum heaven Culture AND good shopping plus the Â 22 000 a year doesn t hurt My interview is Thursday 24th so wish me lotsa luck My back is killing me but it is painkiller time so I should have known better really Can t wait til the osteopath s appointment Today I have Period pains Just thought I d share that 

24	Well I ve just found a mood indicator and I m trying to attatch it to my blog so let s see 

24	It s hot and sticky and I m sweaty and uncomfortable and my back hurts and the neighbours are SO LOUD whinge whinge whinge Day 2 of my incarceration and already I long to return to work Bloody back grrrrrrr 

24	I m justb experimenting with some features on blogger for a moment so if you d like to check out some urlLink poetry click 

24	Somehow I did manage to get some work done yesterday but it wasn t easy It s so nice to have that first day back after the weekend under my belt I feel like I can relax now Horrible incident at work today as we were driving out for a cigarette A group of year 11 boys shouted at Flo french c nt Obviously this was due to the football yesterday but it sickened me Flo tried to brush it off but I couldn t These kids are monstrous and they shouldn t be allowed to get away with it I reported the incident to Ian SMT he was as disgusted as I was I still feel angry for her She s my friend and racism is sick and wrong Other than that things were ok I am so looking forward to not being a teacher particularly to my bottom set year 10 s and 7 s I had one of my agencies contact me today with details of a job I said go for it Fingers crossed good pay 

24	Well I m not desperately trying to avoid doing any work I m not messing around on the internet because I relly don t want to go and mark a load of homework Oh all right I ll go 

24	The internet offers access to a bizarre world Take www subservientchicken com a bloke dressed up in a chicken costume doing whatever you ask him to do Also there s a site called www biddycam com Both are excedingly bizarre I love the internet My favourite site at the moment is www whowouldbuythat com which is just a collection of mad stuff found on ebay and other auction sites Putting them here so that I remember them really Today has been a really easy day at work Year tens then 20 minutes exam envigilation then 1 hour free then year 7s then well then that was it for the day Pretty unusual though Did have a mad panic when I came home though a job application for a national trust job had finally arrived but the closing date was today Phoned them up straight away and after being put on hold for 30 mins I got through to a very understanding lady who emailed me the job application form and I completed it on line I hope I m not prejudiced against because of a crappy postal system 

24	I don t wanna do any housework I don t wanna do any marking You see this is why I generally dislike the summer I m not really an out door person and being hot makes me very reluctant to do anything except watch DVDs and eat chocolate The countdown towards the end of my teaching career has started and I am feeling sort of wistful it ll pass haha My interview date is now on 8th July which is a bit of a bugger as it means I won t be able to teach my a level class but as their exam is over now it will probably be ok Just had Cilip ring me for an interview it s a job agency and the woman seemed really positive I ve also just found another job I want to apply for so I ll do that now before it s too late and my painkillers kick in Love to everyone xxxx 

24	Another hot sticky day I seem to spend my whole life in the shower these days Still at least the skies are nice and blue Work was all right today Nice and contented What really makes me happy though is that my Doctor has finally referred me to an osteopath to get my back treated free on the NHS Oh and my lovely rotary watch has broken so I must get that fixed Quite annoyed about that actually 

24	Ugh it is soo late for me anyway my hellraising days are FAR behind me but Si is asleep finally he stayed up last night playing on his PS2 and I m surprised he s stayed conscious all day Me well I just don t have the tenacity any more I need my sleep and warm milk But I did want to post to all who may be reading that I found out an hour or so ago that I have a job interview and as this blog is supposed to be following my lifestyle change I thought I d better mention it Hopefully I ll remember to elaborate on it further when I wake up 

24	I think that I need to take a break from replying to Job adverts This is one I just emailed in my defense the wording of the advert was humourous and I decided to use the same approach Dear Sir I am writing with regards to a position advertised within the Guardian Jobs Paper Insight co ordinator Trainee Planner working in your London office I am a highly imaginative person with a strange desire to work very very hard in order to justify my existence I would consider myself to be fairly level headed but with a good sense of humour an asset when perhaps a day s work borders on the stressful side of things For the last two years I have been working as an English teacher in a Plymouth Secondary school I am now seeking to move away from that particular career path as I would rather be involved with using my own skills as opposed to passing on skills to others However having been an English teacher I have developed many skills which would be well suited for this position I am highly adept at presenting information in an eye catching way if I am allowed to use PowerPoint then so much the better I am easily able to adapt my manner and speech to different audiences I have no inhibitions about speaking in front of crowds be they well behaved or otherwise and as I am able to control classes of up to thirty five rowdy teenagers then it stands to reason that I must have a certain amount of charm My written and communication skills are of the highest standard In my spare time I like to write children s books which require a high degree of research planning and preparation Every facet of my being is centred towards the ability to plan research and write well As such I believe that not only would this position be a fulfilling one but that I might also prove to be an asset to your company My ability to research and find out obscure facts and details whilst remaining highly organised has lead my colleagues to term me as being quite anal at times But it does also make me successful at pub quizzes my capacity for trivia is unrivalled and my memory is equally impressive I am by no means against hard work Whilst I would be at loathe to compare myself to a donkey I believe that my persistent and hard working nature and the ability to keep my mind fully occupied would make sure that any initial donkeywork is met with no resistance At university I studied as my minor subject Media Arts I focussed particularly on advertising As a result of this I have a good understanding of the advertising world and I am frequently chastised by my friends and family for picking apart every advert that I see I hope that you will consider me for this position 

24	And it s another nice and sunny day I am getting a tan which is always a novel experience for me Sadly the countdown to going back to work has begun just four more days of freedom However as this is to be my last half term as a teacher I am not going to let the job piss me off any more Yesterday I applied for 3 jobs and today I have another 2 to apply for It would be nice to be called to interview this time One of the jobs I m applying for I m really hopeful about One thing has cropped up into my mind which concerns me My back Over the last few days my back has been killing me It feels like the bottom few vertebrae have completely fused together which according to my doctor they probably have and I can t bend over without intense agony Spent most of yesterday curled up on the sofa This does worry me as a librarian I will be required to do some book lifting from time to time Not sure what to do about that Having a bit of a moral dilemma own up about my back problem and I m reducing my chances of getting a job Don t own up and I could end up doing more damage Really bad period pains sorry dad skip to the next paragraph if you re reading this Yesterday they were so intense that I collapsed on the way home from town my legs just gave way under me Plus I have toothache which is very unfair considering I have now virtually eliminated sugar from my diet Yesterday I made a t shirt It has a cartoon picture of Stitch my rat on the front with the words Snitch for President Snitch is her pseudonym in my book which is going quite well at the moment I have nearly finished the 5th story halfway there I have plans to write a sequel where Snitch attempts to take over the world It s the sort of thing that she would do Right let s get these other blooming job applications sorted Then I m going to clean the house and do some marking sob sob sob 

24	Well as many know now I didn t get the job This is getting me down a little I feel to be frank a big useless lump I need job security It s difficult to remember right now how exhausted teaching made me feel The house is a tip the animals smell I think I m turning into poor white trash All I need to do now is bring in the patio furniture and I m set 

24	Still no word I m hating this 

24	Chihuahua For some insane reason this stupid song from the Ministry of Mayhem is trapped in my head Me and Si keep texting it to each other because right now I really need to jazz up my phone bill Jees my feet smell bad If only I could take them off and put them through the washing machine First proper day of the holidays I ve been to the dentist to get my two fillings replaced which didn t hurt at all although now my mouth feels very crowded I ve been living with two gigantic cavities for too long and now I m sitting glaring at my mobile willing Jayne to ring and tell me if I got that job or not I m so nervous I really want this job and the longer I go without hearing anything the more I feel that the news is not good Knowing my luck Jayne s off sick today I m finding it very difficult to motivate myself to do anything until I know It s kinda like savouring that last moment of relaxation if I get the job I m going to have to immediately start a wild flat hunt and if I don t I m going to have to resume my wild job hunt Ring dammit RING Oh and Haru if you re reading this I ve lost your email address please email me 

24	That s it then Over Done I am Miss H no more No longer a teacher Hmmm It s been an emotional drain of a day Right now I m torn between relaxing and getting very drunk I think relaxing will win I abandoned my untidy desk completely because I just had to get home AND RELAX it s been a long week Only 6 of my tutor group managed to make it in today which is laughable I was given another sweet little pot plant as a present from one of my pupils then we watched the final assembly which although very long was great So much creativity I cried at the end when my leaving announcement was made and I was absolutely thrilled by the cheering I received which rather than them cheering that you re leaving is the way the school show how much they love you There was screaming and stamping on the floors which made my heart swell Then I cried some more when students came to hug me goodbye and cried again during my final briefing Carol said some truly wonderful things about me I think it s only when you leave somewhere you can reflect on it and realise how much it s meant to you I made a speech which got a few good laughs and was given a lovely silver bracelet which I was thrilled with It s a lovely memento Then I cried some more because despite all the hard times the school has given me it s given me a whole host of wonderful memories and it really has felt at times like one large family It was such a shame that Colin Chris Matt Justine and dear Marcelle weren t there I will miss everyone dearly Now I feel very tired It s such a lot of people to say goodbye to all in one go I feel quite empty and almost meaningless I hate the fact also that I m technically unemployed I don t quite know who I am at the moment Maybe I should start calling myself a writer Or maybe I should stop defining myself by a profession and just be me for a change a 24 year old woman with her whole life ahead of her And onwards to the London adventure 

24	I ve been at a local theme park today where I did absolutely sweet F A except sit in a cafe writing one of my books It was sooo dull although I did get to see some very cute animals including an adorable litter of kittens and I got my face painted Tomorrow we re off to Birmingham which means I have to get up at 5am so you ll forgive me for making this posting short I have another job interview on Thursday I m feeling very hopeful for this one but I am quite concerned that it might be a maternity contract We shall have to see Did email the person who s set this interview up but she must have gone home 

24	It feels like I have just had the longest sleep in the world oooh just noticed a load of new features have been added to my blog must play with them later I woke up finally after having many dreams that I was heavily pregnant at 12 30pm well over a 12 hour sleep and by god I feel refreshed Very frustrated that I can t find Crank it up as a ringtone download Grrrrr Yesterday was the most wonderful of lazy days where me and Si did absolutely nothing Today will be pretty much the same except that I will reply to some emails and tidy the flat which has gone back to its bombsite look again Friday was my last proper day teaching although this week I still have to go to work to do activities week I received lots of wonderful pressies from my tutor group and a few other students and it feels like I have spent the entire day crying They made me feel so special bless them I ll miss my tutor group so much 

24	Oh good God I only have one day of teaching left tomorrow s sport s day and next week is activities week There is so much going on in my head at the moment that I feel like my brain is going to fuse With that borne in mind I m sure Si will forgive me if I pinch a Krispy Kreme At the moment I am looking up traditional folk tales on the net for my next children s book note to self finish one of the others first I ve always loved fairy tales and I think I have a talent for reworking them but that s been done so often Now I have instead turned my attention to folk tales as they tend to be more neglected and I m going to rewrite them in a very humourous Tony Robinsonesque style But it s been surprisingly difficult to get hold of traditional folk tales on line Bloody Hell a whole paragraph that had nothing to do with teaching or job hunting I d better right that wrong straight away A quite frightening event happened today at work We were all in the English office when we saw hundreds of kids running past a sure sign that a fight had broken out which it had And I m talking hundreds of kids The way the office is positioned we re between two doorways and suddenly a huge banging could be heard We literally jumped up and raced out splitting naturally into two groups to tackle the the doorways John one of our staff was being slammed against one door by the mob the only real word to describe it and I had to hold back the mob from the other door along with the other teachers It was like a scene from Hillsborough They were bashing on the doors and screaming at us and the maths teachers literally poured down from the top corridors We tried to lock the doors but they wouldn t let us One teacher had to literally shove the kids back We locked ourselves in and yet no senior management If we could have got hold of Chris or Matt they would have been on it straight away Afterwards we holed ourselves up in the English office and went into shock a bit We were all shaking and admitted to each other that we had been really scared The kids were like animals Oooooh I ve just found a site which gives you free on line access to hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of actually books which have been typed up Excuse me while I have a fit of excitement Can t type any more must search the site for free books 

24	I m not quite feeling myself today I have a terible sore throat and earache and I m torn between wanting to go to bed and staying on the computer all night The latter will probably win as I have 2 job application profiles to complete on line and a story to type up both needing to be done tonight but I m feeling a little ucky and I wanna cuddle but Si s in London and won t get back home until 11 15pm School was rubbish today I had to do literacy with year 7 s all day and whilst I was glad that I didn t have to teach my grotty year 10s and never will again I had to contend with year 7s a year group who by and large are absolutely vile We wrote poems and I really couldn t have cared less about the whole deal Sigh Must ring my osteopath 

24	I am as ever exhausted This time my neck is really aching as I ve been at the compuper for many hours doing schoolwork type stuff in preparation for my last week I m gonna be doing so much marking for my holidays Went home last night for Anna s hen night It was so much fun dressing up and going out with the girls We went for a chinese and a drink then everyone else went out clubbing except me as my back was killing me It s still killing me but at least I can lie down in a minute It s horrible being in pain when you re at home I ve just written up a help sheet with regards to my tutor group to give to the teacher who s taking over from me It makes me feel so sad to go over all the names Or at least it did Now I m tired and achey and I want to go to sleep which means I m very glad not to be working as a teacher soon 

24	One more week to go one more week to go Thank GOD because I am almost faint with exhaustion at the moment Had an ok time in London yesterday The job looks like it could be quite enjoyable although I don t think the interview went spectacularly well I m sure I ll do better once I ve broken up from work as I m always so shattered come interview day Went to Harrods for more Krispey Kremes had to queue for 30 minutes and went to the Natural History Museum to take a picture of Dorcas for Si and was very scared by all the animals Got back at about midnight feeling suddenly overwhelmed by all of this and having spent at least an hour on the train fighting back tears This morning Si and I overslept This evening we re planning our wedding 

24	Computers give me such headaches And rage Trying to do a very simple thing but it s taking forever Dammit Well I have two job application forms to print up should do that now really 

24	According to my pupils my listening to Jazz Legends CD on a continuous loop is a sign of my vast pretenciousness my words not theirs which perhaps compounds this fact a little Well can t say that I disagree with them I think it s been another pleasant looking day I wore my new Monsoon top in bright Fuschia The lessons were good although my bottom set year sevens nearly made my brain bleed However my other lessons were a good success 8 more teaching days to go 

24	I have had the most fantastic weekend and I have been spoiled absolutely rotten So I want to start off by saying a very big thank you to EVERYONE whop sent me birthday wishes and birthday presents I am touched beyond words at the thoughtfulness of the gifts I have received and I must have cried for every pressie that I opened And I still have Anna s and Phil s presents to look forward to Thank you again I of course will be thanking people individually this isn t my lazy way of getting out of thank you letters but I want to say an especially big thankyou to my darling sexy Si akage no inmo hehehehe for the wonderful day he gave me He bought me such wonderful gifts I have a brown and white panda toy just like in my dream a Shrek 2 sticker album hours of fun a brand spanking new CD walkman so so cool Jazz Legends CD and an art deco trinket box which is too beautiful for words I am the luckiest girl in the world to have such wonderful generous family friends and boyfriend I love you all Si and I yesterday went to Lorenzos to have a meal Coco Chicken note to self must get the recipe and we went to see Shrek 2 which was hilarious I can t recommend it highly enough I spent all day on a very happy high and that high is only just starting to fade now Today with my mum and dad s birthday money I bought a top from Monsoon in fuschia pink all ruffles but is actually office smart and I upgraded my mobile phone to one that takes pictures It s brilliant but I don t have a clue how to work it yet Now I must job hunt then tidy up the flat Then I might try to figure out how to work my phone 

24	It has been such a lovely day today Kids being sooo nice to me I got a birthday card from Sarah A who is a darling and it touched me and also a bunch of flowers from two pupils who were late back from lunch and bought me them as an apology Nicked no doubt but it made me smile a lot I also got some gorgeous pressies from the English crew this most elegant notepad from Monsoon and a really cool rat model although due to the spikes it has I wasn t entirely sure what it was at first So thoughtful Plus a beautiful card made by Kathryn she is so talented they are absolute works of art and it has taken pride f place on my mantel I m going out for a drink with some of the crew tonight although not the English dep and that means I will not see my baby for a few hours So darling duckling I love you more with the passing of each day and I long to hold you in my arms when I return Miss you love you forever xxxxxx And get well soon Ally pally 

24	The shower has taken on a life of it s own again veering wildly between fantastically hot and fucking freezing Every now and then I hear a scream and have to run into the bathroom to see Si cowering away from the watersaying can you just adjust the taps for me honey Oops there he goes Trip to the dentist was uneventful my fillings are still under guarantee so when they get done in a few weeks I won t have to pay Hurrah 

24	Finally got some feedback on the job I went for 2 weeks ago I think it s quite positive We liked G s CV it was very clear contained all the relevant details and her statement of intent was excellent and a very useful summary When it came to her skills section she might consider bullet pointing this so interviewers can see everything at a glance As for the interview she came across well and answered all the questions clearly we also liked her honesty when it came to her teaching background and the reasons why she left it Unfortunately there was a stronger candidate for the post So at least I m not totally useless Very lonely right now The morning and late afternoon is always a time when I miss human interaction the most Yes I have the rats to keep me company but I do miss my friends And I feel a bit headachey and dizzy Gonna go now this PC stuff ain t gonna help my bad back Oh and thanks to Blogger for taking my comments on board 

24	I m trying to have the world s most productive day today I m typing up one of my rat stories doing a cross stitch picture playing with le ratons sterelising the bathroom and kitchen doing 2 washloads hoovering and dusting and general cleaning and answering about 15 emails from my ex pupils A tenner says I ll pass out by 3pm 

24	On Friday night I had the fun task of trying to sort out the mess our wild shower had created Yep the water pressure caused it to veer wildly out of control flooding the bathroom and soaking the ceiling of my neighbours who live below my flat Naturally he was not best pleased and neither when I when insurance figures started floating before my eyes Luckily it all ended well the next day when I went down to speak to him he s going to fix the damage himself But what a pain that was Going home for an evening tomorrow to have a few last minute bridesmaid stuff done 

24	Nightmare day on Friday In the evening before me and Si were about to go out I had a shower There was a surge of water pressure that scorched me I leapt back the shower span out of control and flooded the bathroom It happened so quickly I called Si and as I did so there was an urgent knocking on our front door The water had gone through the floor and flooded downstair s ceiling and light fittings Naturally our neighbour was very angry although his wife was more understanding He thought we d done it on purpose Naturally we offered to pay for the damage and he calmed down but he still gave Si a hard time I was devestated Saturday morning I went down to speak to them and he d calmed down a lot He apologised to Si for being so angry appreciated that it was nobody s fault and as he s a builder he s repairing the damage himself So thankfully no harm done Last night me and Si managed to go out and we saw Spiderman 2 It was actually a great film I really enjoyed it more than I was expecting to We also had a lovely meal at our local restaurant which was excellent as usual I ve decided to apply for some jobs at the local council It seems naive not to try and get a job as nothing in London is forthcoming as yet Neither of us would be unhappy to stay in Plymouth for a little bit longer it would give me a chance to rest and also we could save more money So I m going to apply tomorrow and hope for the best It would certainly give me valuable admin experience

23	Last night Disney held its annual Holiday Party at Disneyland for all employees interns included They closed the park to the public from 7 30 to 12 30 and let the employees run rampant through Disneyland and California Adventure Admission was free for me and a guest and food was discounted still way over priced Lily came with claiming that she was an employee who worked under the Vice President or more accurately ON the Vice President he he he We were suppose to meet all my other intern friends at the part who arrived early to party in Down Town Disney but after several slurred phone calls of What I can t hear you and Wait where are we I gave up hope of ever meeting up with them I guess there was a lot of drama better that I wasn t there and didn t have to deal with it I guess One of the girls was fighting for hours with her 3 year booty call who came along arguments who owed what over the 400 bill arose and another eventually got arrested for being drunk in public Ya only half of the group showed up for work today most with hang overs and one in jail we think not sure So Lil and I regressed to giddy 12 year olds wandering around the park wide eyed We went on all the Fantasy Land rides Peter Pan Snow White Alice in Wonderland my favorite the Casey Jr Train Storybook Boat ride and on the classic It s a Small World Christmas Edition Lil seriously knows the words to every freakin song I couldn t believe it I hadn t even heard half of them and her she was singing along to every single one and blurting out character names I had to have her recap each of the movies for me I felt really old We also hit all the grown up rides like Indiana Jones Haunted Mansion Pirate s of the Caribbean and the Matterhorn Good times I guess these benefits are suppose to make up for the low pay we receive as interns It works for now but I m sure the appeal of receiving free stuff will wear off after a while I have more Disney pens and notepads than freakin Staples and just looking across the hall to my managers office I can imagine what years of collecting this crap arguable for some would look like Scary very scary 

23	It has been a while since I last wrote almost two years Hannah has inspired me to write journals again she just started to a blogger account holdingontothedream blogspot com good name Hannah If anything it will help to relieve my head of the many random and useless thoughts that get tangled up inside it everyday Not that I can t blame my brain for trying to entertain itself with uselss thoughts and unanswerable questions Sitting at work with little to do is an good excuse I guess either way hopefully you ll find my randomness entertaining at the least and maybe even insightfull We ll see 

23	Yesterday Hannah posted a quote in her blog that rings so true for me Women become attracted to the men they fall in love with men fall in love with the women they are attracted to some really smart anonymous guy on craigslist So true All of my serious and significant relationships have been with people who I became good friends with first then I fell in love with who they were and then became incredibly attracted to them physically They were all attractive men but initially their appearance isn t what struck me One of the guys I ve been talking to lately is exactly this He is such an awesome person inspirational funny talented and thinks I m something special always a nice bonus But when I first saw him I wasn t drooling at the mouth however the more we hang out the more I just want to pounce on him I love that we have just remained friends the sexual tension is building and it is exciting Just the way he hugs me is so different weird I know but there s chemistry there I m hanging out with him tonight hopefully I ll have more to report later Lil stop laughing at my crush on Chestnut The other guy I m seeing is totally hot but not so sure about the rest of the package We had a nice dinner and all but it took him a while to warm up I think Again we ll see We re going out on Sun or Mon Enough about boys Hannah s coming home Only 6 days to go and then we re off to Vegas to creating more stories NOT for the grandchildren I just can t wait to be with my ladies and relax party and find that inner child again This corporate work thang makes me feel all old and responsible need a break that s for sure So I had an interview yesterday for a Segment Marketing Associate for Disneyland Resorts down in Anaheim It went well but I can talk to almost anyone so who know how it really went The job would pay bank which is definitely needed at this point I was a victim of a scam last weekend and my bank account was in the red by over 2400 ya don t ask It has been a really really really crappy week all will be taken care of soon Next I will be interviewing with the VP of Marketing and her senior manager a formality I think more than anything bc I probably wouldn t see her again after that So keep your fingers crossed The job sounds fabulous the only bad thing is that I d have to move to the OC again I think Long Beach would be fun Kim I m thinking of you and your love for the LB and it has the same initials as me ahh how cute I m such a planner so it is hard to be in limbo between where I m working where I m living and how I ll be paying my bills I must be patient as my mom would say I have no patience so this is a challenge 

23	So today is the day I ve been waiting for Hannah is home and we re off to VEGAS I can barely contain myself This morning I woke up with such vigor it was amazing I underestimated the excitement of seeing a best friend I haven t seen in a while and acting a fool with all those who know you the best Ahhhh such contentment right now The car is getting washed money has been withdrawn legs have been shaved and The diamond studded Vegas shoes have been packed Holy cow I am afraid of the amount of fun we re going to have this weekend My nervous system is on overdrive just in anticipation of the stories I ll come home with I m definitely going to a tad bit more tame than I was last year but just a tad Stay tuned bc I m sure I ll some stories to share or not share Wooooooooooooooooooo freakin hoooooooooooooooooooooooo and I m off 

23	Today I finally feel that someone in the world of business actually has a heart and is interested in my best interest and not just the company s As some of you know I ve had to make a rash decision to accept a job that isn t exactly what I want to do and doesn t fit my criteria for a full time job with benefits and all I was in the process of interviewing for a job I really wanted down at Disneyland Corporate in marketing but was forced before I could go to the second interview to accept a casual position with in my current group doing retail analytics If I didn t accept the job then I could potentially be unemployed everyone s worst fear in these times In order to gather the most information I could before making a decision I called the recruiter for the marketing job down at Disneyland to see where I stood as a candidate and if I really had a good chance of getting hired on She talked with the main guy that I interviewed with and called me back saying that while I consistently came up on the top of their list they were a little hesitant because I don t have direct marketing experience After that discussion I decided that I was better off being safe than sorry So here is where the shit hit the fan pardon the expression I was at lunch meeting today with my manager and our director whom I ve always gotten along with and when she found out that the manager trying to hire me in our group forced me to tell her today if I d take the job or not she was furious She actually cared that I was being forced against my will to make a decision that really wasn t in my best interest Then she proceeded to tell me that she d give me a recommendation and that she d talk to the director overseeing the open position to see if something could be worked out halleluiah Someone is trying to help me out I was just floored Now I need all of you to keep your fingers crossed and hope that I can go through second round interviews that they are convinced through recommendations from my manager and director that I can do the job and that I get hired as a Segment Marketing Associate for Disneyland Resorts Finally on a career path Time will tell more on this later Funny how as soon as you think things are settled and you know what you ll be doing for the next 6 months that things change so abruptly Now I m back to we ll see So here s a much more fun topicÃ â Â boys Okay I m not 12Ã â Â Anyway it happened Just like that last night I started becoming very attracted to Cesare It is weird like all of a sudden he looked different to me I started to see HIM and not just the physical It was pretty cool I kinda sad bc he left this morning for Europe and Chicago to see family and won t be back until Jan 10 Boo That s okay though bc I m going to VEGAS Yes Ladies and gentlemen 1 5 days until we re off on another girls only weekend I can t wait these last 3 weeks have been way too stressful Some steam will be let out on the dance floor that is for sure

23	Gotta love living in California earthquake country An earthquake struck just a few minutes ago leaving our 32 story building swaying like a drunkard and its contents us feeling dizzy and confused I have no idea how strong the earthquake was but it must have been a big enough one to make the building creek and sway What a sense of loss of control which now kinda freaks me out Talking about loss of control here s the Vegas low down 1 Actually quite calm compared to previous visits 2 Few really cute boys in town but more people than last year 3 Tons of fun had by all both acting like 6th graders in the hotel room or shaken it on the dance floor 4 I ate it trying to step over the divider into our VIP booth falling on my ass with a skirt on and flashing all around Nice Liz real nice 5 Not too much money won by anyone Lil won 40 once but the rest of us didn t win jack Booooo 6 Lovely to reconnect with friends and remember that these are the people who will always be around to share life with 7 Remembered or realized that transition isn t easy but that it is worth hitting the bumps along the way to get back in the swing of things again 8 VEGAS rocks it always will and next year we ll tear it up again 9 Next year we ll fly or at least I won t drive the drive there isn t bad but the drive back sucks a fat one 

23	For my friends on the job tip or who are just plain interested in what our economy is doing For all of 2003 the economy grew by a solid 3 1 percent and represented the strongest showing since 2000 For out of work Americans though it may not feel like better economic times Job growth has been slow The nation s payrolls grew by a scant 1 000 jobs in December disappointing economists and frustrating jobseekers The economy has lost 2 3 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001 good one Bushy way to go on improving quality of life for all The president believes a stronger economy will lead to more jobs Democrats point to the job losses as evidence of what they say are the president s failed economic policies Analysts are hopeful that stronger job growth will take place later this year looks like the anticipated 2nd quarter job growth is now pushed back just great as businesses feel more confident in the economy and see their bottom lines improve

23	Ahh I forget what it is like to get a full night s sleep I was out for the count at about 9 30 I couldn t help it I had a bowl of chicken dumping soup for dinner then proceeded to take a warm bath and followed by a half hour of perusing the pages of Newsweek What could be a better recipe for a good night s sleep Okay I can think of one or two things but for a regular Monday night in the studio alone I think I did pretty well My whole life I have never been a big reader While I have always enjoyed magazines and national geographic like anyone actually reads that one anyway I just never had this urge to read It was always last on my list of things to do If all my friends were busy the dogs weren t in a rambunctious mood and it wasn t nice or early enough to take a jaunt around the neighborhood then I may read if staring at the wall got too boring I don t know my deal But all is changing During the last few years of college I began to enjoy taking time out to read Sitting in front of the boob tube for a while made my brain feel like it was becoming softer by the minute always being stimulated by something outside not internal effort required TV can t be good for you I m convinced that during my Junior year in High School I became quite dense from the summer of TV watching Thankfully college stimulated many of the previously numbed neurons and having a roommate to exchange thoughts with also helped I guess what I m trying to say is that last night I was reminded of how much I do enjoy reading It is relaxing you are learning your brain is working and it opens your eyes to new ideas For many of you reading this you re thinking Duh but just thought I d share What I m going to do with this read more So send your book recommendations this way 

23	I have a new job now that I started on Jan 5th My offical title is Finanial Analyst II really exciting I know My work phone number is the same besides the last four digits Change the 4405 to 5294 

23	It has been a while since I wrote last before Christmas I guess Since a lot and little has happened I ve been on more vacations this holiday season that ever which is making the daily trek to work just that much harder After Christmas in Fremont with the family I ventured back to LA to spend New Years with Hannah and the gang at our friend Jeremy s in the Valley At first what looked like a Pleasantville high school dance eventually turned into a proper New Years champagne popping horns blowing and most importantly of all drunken booty shaken to celebrate 2004 Quite a nice time no kisses but definitely fun Oh and just for kicks and to remind ourselves that we are sexy women we dressed to the nines in dresses heals and all Then came my 23rd birthday on Wednesday Jan 14th Yup I m officially the oldest of my friends Even the guy I m dating is younger than me It still was wonderful and once again my friends revealed to me just how much I m loved lucky girl I must say Lily Tracey and Loreg sp took me out to this Spanish place called La Luna Negra Ohhh the sangria was to die for and the food even better On Thursday night the work gang and I headed out to the Burbank Bar Grill to take advantage of the happy hour good times Friday was awesome Cesare took me to this swanky restaurant called Crustation in Beverly Hills I had crab a whole crab that is that was marinated in butter and garlic holy cow what a party in my mouth The evening was fabulous and I m definitely appreciative to have a man that has taste Friday night at about 11 30 Cesare dropped me off at the airport I was taking the red eye to New Orleans to meet Hannah for our tour of the Big Easy Lily was suppose to accompany us but she became deathly ill the night before and couldn t join Boooo Once I finally arrived after a stop in Minneapolis MN Hannah and I took right to the Big Easy First stop Binets French donuts then we bought Cigars for that night and then we headed to Pat O Brien s for a Hurricane We were set to take over and definitely live it up in the Big Easy well it had different plans for us Around 5pm it started raining cats and dogs pouring like I ve never seen it Hannah and I soaked headed back to the hotel to rest and nap before that night s festivities Bourbon Street Hannah treated me to dinner for my birthday We weren t sure where to go but after consulting the concierge we decided on a Creole restaurant named Murielle s Holy cow definitely one of the best meals I have ever had in my life Everything was unbelievable and just melted in your mouth So when in New Orleans go to Murielle s That night we got on our party tops and headed to Bourbon Street Ya basically we were in bed by 1 30 Bar after bar we tried to find some place that has some class and just wasn t full of disrespect Quite an eye opener The last straw was when some gross pervy guy rubbed his stuff on Hannah s calf ya it was time to go The next night we ended up at a nice club called 360degrees Quite nicer and definitely more our speed We danced the night away and enjoyed experiencing a club in the south Overall we had a blast but I definitely can cross New Orleans off the list and don t think I ll be returning any time soon The best part of the whole trip was the Funeral parade that we were fortunate enough to see on Sunday It was amazing The street was full of Tuba s the guy who died friends and family and also mixed in tourists and funeral regualars Boys played on their Saxiphones trumpets and tubas perfectly performing many hot popular radio songs People were dancing in the streets drinkin and just celebrating life We overhead one woman wisper quite a profound statement that made all the maddness infront of us make sense How you live is how you die Sounds simple and obvious but really it is so true Celebrating the life of the deceased is so much more important and less selfish than mourning for them Really death is a time of celebrating one s accomplishments and simply who they are Easier said than done I m sure But that is how I want to go in many many years that is with a celebration 

23	Interesting article regarding health and diet from MSN I guess it s true You are what you eat It s a bird it s a plane it s walnuts Don t laugh The humble walnut along with a dozen other dietary choices from beans to yogurt is no less than a superfood say some health experts Steven Pratt MD is one of them In his new book SuperFoods RX Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life he goes into detail why he thinks these foods are so potent Pratt an ophthalmologist who specializes in ocular plastic surgery at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla Calif says he became convinced of the power of these basic foods when he saw the positive results of a few simple diet changes in his patients suffering from age related macular degeneration a leading cause of blindness Whether you re trying to prevent cataracts macular degeneration cancer or cardiovascular disease the same type of preventive dietary measures apply he says The whole body is connected a healthy heart equals a healthy eye and healthy skin You ll hear about all these special diets for special health needs but really the same diet and the same lifestyle choices prevent the same diseases With rare exceptions you don t need 20 different preventive modalities just one really good diet And that one really good diet Pratt says should be founded on these superfoods Beans Blueberries Broccoli Ya Berger Miss Broccoli USA Oats Oranges Pumpkin Pumpkin Pie count Salmon had it twice last week Soy Spinach Tea green or black Greeen every morning except today I m out so I m having Black Chai Tea Tomatoes Turkey My favorite Walnuts yummy in salad and free from Uncle Larry the farmer Yogurt When incorporated into your regular daily diet these foods says Pratt can stop some of the changes that lead to diseases such as diabetes hypertension Alzheimer s and some cancers I picked them out after researching all of the world s healthiest diets for example Japanese diets Mediterranean diets and even some of the healthier dietary patterns in the United States he says I noticed that it s the same food groups wherever you live Walnuts The Good Fat Every nut even macadamias the fattiest has been found to improve cholesterol Pratt reports Walnuts are among the superstars They re an excellent source of plant based omega 3 fatty acids he says Salmon is another great source of these heart healthy fatty acids Studies show that you can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease by 15 to 50 if you eat a handful of nuts five times a week If you found a pill that did the same thing you d make a fortune Of course chowing down on a huge tub of walnuts can be counterproductive so as always watch your intake A handful of dry roasted unsalted walnuts about 14 walnut halves has about 150 calories and is enough to yield superfood benefits Add Some Color to Your Diet It is true that good things come in small packages Used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes blueberries are a tiny fruit that combines a wide variety of nutrients Blueberries don t have a huge amount of any single nutrient but they have the synergy of multiple nutrients Pratt says There s vitamin C folic acid fiber carotenoids and hundreds of other compounds in this one small fruit Blueberries also have a very thick skin which is where nature packs most of its nutrients When you re thinking superfoods think color says Beverly Clevidence PhD a research leader at the USDA s Diet and Human Performance laboratory That means foods that are deep blue purple red green or orange They contain health enhancing nutrients that protect against heart disease and cancer and also improve our sense of balance our memory and other thinking skills Nutritionist Kathleen Zelman MPH RD director of nutrition of the WebMD Weight Loss Clinic offers these tips on how to add some color to your diet Top your cereal with almonds or berries add tomatoes to sandwiches soups or stews layer your whole grain bread sandwich with slices of peppers and fresh spinach Pack a snack bag of nuts baby carrots raw broccoli grape tomatoes and bell pepper slices for a nutritious pick me up between meals Fruit and nut granola bars stash easily into briefcases for quick energy and a tasty treat Soy for Cholesterol No adding soy to your diet does not mean pouring more soy sauce on your Chinese food says Leslie Bonci MPH RD LDN director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center It does mean adding soy foods such as tofu soy milk soy nuts or the green soybeans called edamame by the Japanese Not everyone is convinced about soy s heart healthy benefits but its cholesterol lowering benefits do seem powerful enough A study reported July 2003 in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that a diet of soy fiber protein from oats and barley almonds and margarine from plant sterols lowered cholesterol as much as statins the most widely prescribed cholesterol medicine Tofu takes on the flavor of foods that it is cooked with says Zelman Try a stir fry of colorful veggies and cubed tofu with a light Asian sauce for a quick meal You can also find cereals at the store loaded with both soy and fiber Serve with skim milk and you ll get three super nutrients for breakfast Take a soy protein bar for a quick snack or lunch during the day Soy nuts are another great portable snack option Edamame Japanese name for green soybeans are snacks even kids will love Find these nutritious nuggets in the freezer section at your supermarket Serve them plain or with a low fat dip Fiber for Your Whole Body Beans and oats are great sources of fiber Fiber helps keep our cholesterol and blood sugar levels low and our bowels functioning smoothly Studies show that dietary fiber including foods such as apples barley beans and other legumes fruits and vegetables oatmeal oat bran and brown rice clearly lower blood cholesterol High fiber foods are also digested more slowly so they don t cause spikes in blood sugar levels like white bread potatoes and sweets do Of course everyone knows that fiber helps keep you regular High fiber foods also help us feel full making it easier to control weight Read food labels to find whole grain breads and cereals that provide three or more grams of fiber per serving says Zelman A bowl full of bran or high fiber cereal is a great start Whole fruits and veggies are great for a healthy dose of fiber Aim for five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day for a healthy dose of fiber Juices don t contain as much fiber as whole fruit And beans are loaded with fiber and protein so add them to soups stews salads eggs and salsas Calcium for Your Bones Yogurt and other dairy products help keep your bones strong and lessen your chance of fractures as you get older calcium also keeps teeth strong helps your muscles contract and your heart beat Recent studies have even shown that calcium may lower your risk of colon polyps and help you lose weight Researchers at Purdue University found that women who consume calcium from low fat dairy products or get at least 1 000 milligrams a day showed an overall decrease in body weight Dairy products are the best source of calcium Choose skim milk low fat yogurt and low fat cheese to avoid saturated fats A single serving can provide you with 20 of the 1 200 milligrams a day you need You can also add calcium to your diet with calcium enriched cereals and orange juice Foods such as dark green vegetables dried beans and sardines also contain calcium Start your day with café au lait made with half skim milk and half strong coffee says Zelman Add a bowl of whole grain cereal topped with skim milk and fresh fruit for a breakfast of champions Snack on low fat yogurt or cheese between meals for an energizing treat Another plus for the superfoods they can all be found in pretty much every supermarket in every town in America You might not be able to buy bok choy everywhere but every grocery store sells broccoli Both dark green leafy vegetables with similar health benefits broccoli makes the superfood list and bok choy is one of its sidekicks So are superfoods for real or just another diet book gimmick in a market flooded with them I think it s a good message says Beth Kitchin MS RD assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the University of Alabama Birmingham There s good data to support the health benefits of all these foods They re what we might call functional foods because you eat them for a very specific purpose The walnuts and the salmon are a great source of omega 3 fatty acids yogurt is a great source of calcium and natural bacterial cultures that help maintain a healthy digestive tract and tea has been shown over and over again to have a role in preventing some cancers Can you lose weight on a superfoods diet Of course you can says Pratt although that s a side benefit The Superfoods way of looking at things is a lifestyle choice not a weight loss program he says But if you make these foods a lifestyle choice you ll feel better and you ll look better With reporting by Carol Sorgen

23	Yesterday I was feeling very unsatisfied with my job For the first time since I took this new position I browsed online job postings looking for anything a little more intriguing Preferable somthing in marketing or business development Well a man named Sandy with impecable timing e mailed me regarding an analyst position with Notel Co their sole comodity Ketle One Vodka He is a headhunter within the wine and spirts sector and seems like quite the sales man I sent in my resume today and hopfully will be interviewing on Friday Only problem the job is in Laguna Nigel back in the OC It is not that I don t like the OC it is just that I moved to LA to pursue opportunities out here and to live in a place that always has things to do and that is full of diversity OC is nice but boring We ll see Way to early to tell if I ll even get the interview keep your fingers crossed though I could use the raise 

23	Today has been a good day Went to bed early last night around 10 00 Belinda called at 10 15 and was like Old Lady The new featherbed mattress is like the best thing ever My bed was a little firm so this has made any minor back ach I used to have vanish thanks mom So I woke up feeling extremely refreshed and rejuvenated Then when I put on my work khakis that I ware probably once a week they were loose Ya man waist line is diminishing or at least today isn t expanding Always a good start to the day Then I made the most fabulous lunch and trotted off to work only 10 minutes late not the usual 20 Ya man a morning was much needed Over the last month I have been spoiled rotten with excellent meals Not just good meals over the top excellent It all started with Christmas dinner at the Anderson s one of the best ever then was followed by yummy dinner at Hannah s house her mom s lasagna then my birthday dinner at La Luna Negra then another birthday dinner at Crustation with Cesare who many times has tantalized my palate over the last two months then one the best dinners ever at Murielle s in New Orleans compliments of Hannah then dinner with Mom at the Vineyard Room at CA Adventure and finally on Thursday fine dinning at Yamashiro s with Cesare Mixed in many dinners lunches and mornings from Starbucks to Burbank Bar and Grill to Sushi Zawa All of this to tell you that I have found a new appreciation for food Red Robin just doesn t do it for me anymore Ambiance coupled with rich petite dishes are what I crave lately Fresh ingredients and even organic products have made their way into my cupboard Don t get me wrong convenience still occasionally wins over decadence last night for example a can of Chicken Dumpling soup garlic bread with olive oil and a bite of Cadbury chocolate to finish the meal sufficed Still different than what I previously would of concocted Instead of the organic garlic bread from traders and olive oil special delivery from Italy thanks Cesare I would of had Lo cal toast with butter spray I m not saying that a burger and fries isn t on my wish list anymore but simply that I ve discovered that quality was under rated in my book Thanks to all that made fine dinning possible for me Hannah Lil Tra Cesare Mom and Mrs Anderson The party in my mouth continues 

23	Thank you to Kim and Hannah who finally updated their blogs Whether it be full of profound statements or blabbering on about nothing I enjoy learning about what is going on in my friend s lives I wish more of them blogged This weekend was really nice My mom was in town Friday morning until Sunday afternoon On Friday we went to Disneyland and California Adventure for free of course thanks Mickey and ate at the most wonderful restaurant for dinner at CA Adventure I wasn t looking forward to eating at the park Past experience says that park food is too expensive tastes cheap and is greasy Well for all of you fine dinners out there go to California Adventure s The Vineyard Room Seafood soup a main course salmon for me chicken for my mom and a chocolate cheesecake souffle all went down the hatch effortlessly All the while our openly gay waiter rolled his eyes in jealously wishing he could have a bite but arguing with himself over the calories funny but slightly disturbing at times We left Disneyland happy campers the parks goal accomplished happy customers who spent a lot of money Saturday mom and I headed down to Santa Monica We walked on the beach walked down 3rd street promenade sipped on Mochas and went to see the movie House of Sand and Fog compliments of Cesare Then we were off to dinner at another Italian restaurant The first table the hostess sat us at wasn t good enough for the Madre so we moved into a cozy corner where on the left a first meeting of a boyfriend and the family was taking place and on the right a model type her mom and her way cute gay looking man sat nibbling on tomatoes and mozzarella Good dinner and good conversation Mostly about the movie good but depressing Makes you think which in my mind is always a sign of a good movie It made me realize that forcing anything will only make this worse for you and probably for other people as well You have to see the movie to fully understand but take this advice If it isn t meant to be then let it be don t force it Things have their place and their time to settle all will work out A lesson I still struggle to learn but at least I know that I shouldn t force things Whether I do or not well that is a whole nother issue The other thing I realized this weekend is that everyday I take so many things for granted We all do I guess but things like feeling the sun on your face or the smell of a forest are all things I love and feel good yet I rarely experience Do I go outside during the day Nope Do I take walks on the weekend in a wooded area Nope Watch TV go to the mall go to bars eat out make out ya need to get back in touch with the simple things in life Really cheesy I know but something I realized while at California Adventure on the ride Soaring over California Remember this next time you re having a bad day Sit in warm water and feel its warmth Take the deepest breath you can in a place with clean air of course and feel your lungs fill deep in your belly this one is a good one it is amazing how little we use our full lung capacity I m sure everyone has their own things to help them feel in touch again these are two of mine Working in an office sitting on my ass and trying to keep myself mentally stimulated all day isn t good for me hence why I come up with these stupid things to keep me going Ah need to change directions but right now I ll let things be I kinda feel like something good is on the horizon we ll see

23	Quick update before my meeting talked with Cesare on Wednesday night and we are now going to continue dating but just casually nothing too serious First he said he didn t know how we got to the point of ending it ya hello you said you wanted to be friends and then all became clear on what was really going on in his head that night He is afraid of getting too latched on and then loosing sight of the big picture Kim you were right I can see what he means it can happen when people start getting serious Especially right now in our lives a significant other isn t what we should be focusing on So all is good now we ll see how it goes It lifts a lot of pressure off of me to be ready to commit to him so that is nice I guess In other news last night Michelle and I headed to Skybar for pre club drinks We thought it would be fun since we ve never been So nice inside and damn it was so freakin romantic Great place for a date or just an intimate evening We were lounging on the stairs sitting on pillows when an Argentinean man swaggers over and plops down next to us and close to us not the same sense of personal space I guess We re chatting and eventually wonder over to meet his friends who were laying yes laying down on the huge mattress by the bar Michelle and one of his friends taking a liking to one another and I continue talking to my new friend can t remember his name Then the Moet is poured and he toasts To our first child Whoa funny these South American guys weird The second glass and toast To our second child That one was followed by in broken English Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me At this point I just was laughing what guys will say to get some Being the klutz that I am a little champagne dribbled on my chin and he lungs at my face and starts to kiss lick it off what the hell Back off there bucco This continued and eventually I had to keep pushing him away and said don t make me violent bc I will That s right Anyway supposedly he was a professional golfer in Argentina and he and his friends were just traveling around the US before his season starts back up again We had to leave to go to the Century Club so I wondered over to find Michelle and there she was making out with the other guy oh so weak She jumped up with no problems and we bounced Funny evening and could have been quite eventful if we had stayed there all night Century club was kinda ghetto I have never seen so many short ass tight skirts in my life it seemed like there were video hos everywhere It was suppose to be Allen Iverson s party thingy which I m sure is just a ploy to get people there We didn t have to pay since we were on the list thank god but damn were people using every tactic to cut in line It was ridiculous both guys and girls were cutting and coercing ridiculous Good music danced a lot but that s all Left at about 1 00 and headed home Overall a fun night and definitely new experiences A new guy has joined our team at work I am going to be working directly with him on our In Store execution project where I may be going to NY to help train Not sure if I get to go yet but we ll see He is cool and seems to have a lot of industry experience so that is nice Totally flamboyant too which is fun and already he makes me laugh seems like we ll get along just fine I ve been happier at work bc I m actually getting things to do and being exposed to other sides of the business I just think I need to work on communicating to my manager when I feel bored or unchallenged I m sure she d help to find things for me or to at least let me go to meetings just to listen in Another thing to work on yippie Speaking of things to work on I need to become more emotionally self sufficient I depend way too much on my friends and family to help me through the harder times It is not like I have a lot of them but when I do I just can t seem to function without being depressed or mopey I need to get over it and just deal with the pain and work through it on my own Things do work out eventually just at the time I hurt so badly that I want to talk to a friend someone who knows me and loves me for who I am Still I m sure it gets old and I don t need to be bogging my friends down with my issues not that they don t want to know what is going on but whatever I still need to be less reliant on others to feel emotional secure Through the Cesare experience though I did get reminded of what I deserve and how I deserve to be treated a very important lesson Life is all about learning and growing I guess Mistakes are made here and there but overall if you re learning from those and moving on then I guess that s what matters My manager just came in and was like what are you doing so I better move on and get some work done 

23	It has been way too long since the last time I wrote A lot has happened though I ve been in such emotional turmoil and confusion that I don t think I could of wrote a clear and complete sentence So aside from my last few entries on food get over it Liz Cesare decided that on Friday night the day before Valentine s may I remind you to break it off no not break off a piece to end us the dating Shocker to say the least I guess when I told him on Tuesday that I wasn t sure if I was ready to call him my BF it affected him a lot more than he lead on He said that after that moment he started thinking which lead to these conclusions my life is just starting maybe I don t want to be committed been in these situations before where both people don t feel the same and got hurt I think you re great want to hang out but not for a while can t handle it yet We both were a mess crying and talking I was in such shock I didn t know what to feel or think or do for that matter It took me two whole hours just to figure out what he was trying to tell me I original thought he just wanted to slow it down not end it After hours of confusion I left At first I thought this is okay It s meant to be I wasn t in love with him and don t know if I ever could of been Then I get home hours pass and I start thinking about it more and more sitting in the bar have to leave bc I m crying talking on the phone start crying a mess a complete mess Didn t expect to be that way but apparently I didn t realize how much I liked him until he was gone Story of my life I tell you Anyway long story short once again my friends pulled me through it going out with me and just chatting with me on the phone I still am sad and still miss him I want to be with him how long our relationship with last I don t know but I know that as of right now I have strong feelings for the quirky guy I was a little unsure of I began to love all the little things i was unsure of about him As of now we haven t talked He wrote a little e mail in response to my call requesting we hang out saying wants to hang out in the next few weeks but isn t ready yet I wrote back saying that I wanted to talk about this bc I feel that now that I ve been about to digest some of this we can actually talk about what he s feeling so we ll see if he picks up my call tonight Ahh why I remember it is so much easier to be single and not deal with this ish THANK YOU to my girlfriends to which I would not be sane or dry eyed at this moment if it wasn t for them I m still wierded out by how much this affected me Had a second interview today with Ketel One I think it went well but I may have messed it up at the end we ll see I m not even sure how I feel about moving anyway at this point Tomorrow night I plan on shakin my booty on the dance floor Allen Iversen is hosting some party at the Century Club so I want to go hopefully Lil will want to join me I know Michelle and Claudia are going but Claudia and Lil don t mix so we have to avoid that situation This weekend is totally open more cleaning I think I cleaned out my bathroom the other night when I was bumbed out the best medicine alone and I felt like my Chi was relieved better flowing and less bogged down Damn just think how I d feel if I actually cleaned out my whole place Working on it 

23	Okay guess things are back up and running I thought they cut me off for blabbering Last night we hit The Standard Downtown It was pretty hot very good place for a first date and drinks with friends Seeing that it was a Tuesday night the roof top bar was filled with mostly business men and a lot of foreigners I m assuming hotel guests which made for an interesting and eclectic crowd Design wise very LA and very mod Everything was red The carpet chairs tables okay some were yellow lighting even the bartenders were wearing all red outfits The best part besides the open air and city view downtown LA skyscrapers surrounding were the water beds that line one side of the pool Yes that s right water beds I haven t sat on one of those things since I was like 8 when my parents had one of those half waterbeds half mattresses suppose to help support the lower back They were encapsulated in these red of course space age like domes with little eye drop cut outs so that you could climb though and plop Being the slightly perverted ole me I slapped the water bed and said Ah now doesn t that sound familiar I m horrible Everyone was busting up but still who s the Ho now hu Just fabulous They also had an old time movie playing that was projected on the wall of the building across the street Couldn t hear anything but a cute idea Music was this retro funk stuff that got old after a while but eventually after 12 the dj started playing some hip hop so of course I made way out on the dance floor I ended up dancing with some guys one of which was some scary weird metro sexual type The other who I had spotted across the room earlier and said hey hey now he ended up asking for my digits Gave them to him but don t think I ll talk if he calls Anyway good times and definitely a place to take out of towners for a very LA experience during the week that is On the weekends I hear it is way stuffy and the 10 20 cover is enough to turn me away especially if I m just going to chill and hang out and not be at a club 10 parking Gin and Tonic 9 Long Island 12 If you were a true baller this would be a great place to rent out for a party or special event Smokers can smoke intimate places for getting to know you moments and plenty of room to mingle and dance if there was appropriate music that is

23	Miss Kim is on her way to stardome Little by little she is making her way into the big business of publishing Keep your eyes peeled for Her Home a magazine that is on shelves at Barns and Noble and soon to be at Wal Mart I m working on finding opportunities as well in the publishing arena My dream to be an editor of an interesting hip magazine Baby steps they say Just trying to get my foot in the door right now sending e mails mailing resumes talking to people et I know that if I put my whole self into it something has got to happen At least some sort of opportunity that is remotely related Even if it was in PR and then a move into magazine editorial We ll see but keep your eyes peeled for me Work is getting better Seem to fit better with my manager now Not that we didn t get along before but we never chatted Now I am taking more of an initiative to go talk to her keep her updated on what I am doing and let her know what I d like to do in the future we have gelled better She already suggested writing Barbara Walters just for kicks to see if I could do a meet and greet or something ABC is part of the mouse house maybe she needs an assistant Ya right but what do I have to lose right Diane Sawyer is also a mouse house member so should try her as well I m waiting until I have a clear vision of what I want before I start contacting people then all hell s going to break loose I still think one of my ultimate jobs would be for work for oprah in some capacity I just love that woman and love her shows They aren t retarded like most talk shows they re classy and interesting Many don t agree I m sure but if I had TiVo I d tape it everyday Oh what a devoted fan She s coming to LA tickets are like impossible to get but I m going to give it a shot anyway You never know I also thought it may be fun to work for a travel company and help host tours around the world Most likely though it would get boring because you probably do the same tour over and over again How fun it would be would depend on your group and that you have no control over Just a thought though I may be going to Hawaii in the next month or so Diana lives there and thinks what I need is some time to rejuvenate my spirit and to restate my priorities find myself again I agree 100 What a better place to do that than Hawaii I can get a round trip ticket for about 330 won t have to pay for lodging or that much food and will only have to take maybe 1 day off work which I can make up so no missing days pay Sounds like a plan to me now I must see how the finances are doing and then I ll know when it is actually possible to go My computer died the other day too so that is another thing on the list to buy I can t spend too much time at work on line researching publishing companies and searching for jobs so I really need to get my home base started up again Hopefully I ll be moving in with someone within the next month so that I ll be about to save money on rent I need to head out to Nebraska too to visit Kim and George Never been but always always visit my friends where ever they move at least once Just my thang I guess This morning I had a breakfast burrito from our restaurant downstairs and damn was it good Not really worth the fat and calories but definitely scrumcious Now I feel like there is a rock in my tummy It is only 12 00 and I ve already had 3 pieces of chocolate a Breakfast Burrito and an orange better lay off for the rest of the day At least I worked out last night Squats up the hill in front of my apartment pushups on the brick wall across the street and ran 1 mile and walked another Today at lunch in a minute that is I m going to head home and do a little pilates I think it will help me feel energized for the rest of the day I get so drained sitting her all day Thank god for blogging and for friends e mails or else I d be bored out of my mind 

23	So today has once again made me realize things I didn t want to know Things I didn t even want to think were possible Once again I think I trusted too much and made assumptions on what little I knew of a person Lil has reminded me that guys are guys and that I shouldn t be surprised when I think that they may be playing games just to get what they want and then take off Sad but may be what my situation was about Don t 100 think that is what happened bc there are a lot of other factors that don t add up to that but could be a really good act Whatever Hung out with you know who on Sunday Treated me like any other Joe Schmoe you d run into on the street Not sure if that a forced I must only like and treat you like a friend or if that s a I never really had strong feelings for you anyway thing Moving on Last night I had a great absolutely wonderful conversation with an old friend from Jr High We ve known each other since grade school but didn t become good friends until Jr High Diana is so full of life and she is the most spontaneous wild and utterly giddy person I have ever met She goes through a lot bc she takes a lot of risks but after it all she still has a love and passion for life Amazing Just chatting with her last night filled my soul with a little bit of the fire that I ve been missing I ve realized that I ve been sitting on the sidelines watching my life go by and not playing hard in the game So today I wrote some e mails I ve been meaning to get out did some research about potential fulfilling careers and am trying to LIVE Weird but sometimes I forget how to or I forget that this is my life my story and only I can dictate how it goes day to day I also said something last night like When I m forty Diana stopped me and said Liz no one ever guaranteed you 40 Wow never really thought about that We assume that these dreams we re putting off will eventually come true Well who knows what we ll accomplish so as long as we enjoy and make the most of each day that is what should be important People create their own happiness and misery I just need to find out exactly what makes me tick and then go from there in creating my life story and what makes me happy Only I know what will fulfill me Damn a time for growing is understating what it is like graduating form school and being thrown in eh real world will all doors open to you I m lucky that all doors are open to me a lot of people don t have that option So I better take control of that and find which one I want to open If anything I hope this reminds you that making your life great and enjoyable is up to you take control bc no one else will 

23	New day at work and got irritated with one of my managers He knows he definitely was being a little softer around me I m stubborn he s stubborn doesn t always make for a smooth meeting At our staff meeting today though he got a little cut off so I think he s getting the point that he s the new kid on the block and needs to step back a little be less aggressive but still communicate his ideas Found out today that my exboyfriend Dan got into GW University and American University in DC for grad school I think he is pursuing a masters in Public Administration Congrats Dan my hat goes off to you for making it happen He ll excel no matter where he goes Said he ll be there come August Berger if you ll still be there Dan s coming to town Great quote I found the other day Makes you rethink what kind of people you surround yourself with but at the same time is a little harsh I don t fully subscribe to this but it is important to have role models who don t have an agenda for you i e parents boyfriends and even some friends Eagles don t fly with turkey s Kinda lame quote I know but makes a point I think Mat is right see his blog that if people just had more sex safe sex then the world would be a better place I have my own issues regarding sesso but when you feel good about yourself and sexy and have a safe and comfortable environment to be intimate life is good And on the gay marriage thing shouldn t we be celebrating love where ever we find it in this day and age Seriously people need to get over their phobias and let people live which applies to many other social issues as well I m excited for my busy weekend ahead Starting tonight with sushi and sake with Jeremy then dinner with Lil finally we haven t seen each other in two weeks on Thursday second date with Stephan on Friday brunch on Saturday morning with Jennifer from work and the Charity event on Saturday night Definitely a lizzie weekend jam packed with no time to let my brain wonder off and start pondering life and all that I am suppose to be doing In my mom s words I need to Chill out Ya my mom said that You re going to go crazy if you keep stressing yourself out Have a glass of wine already Good advice mom And yes I may be going crazy but hell what a better place than LA to do that As Lily would say Look at all the freaks Since many of my friend s claim they are a little nuts as well at least I know that they ll still love me if I went nut balls I bet most of them already think I m there 

23	My gosh it has been a while since I ve written but I ve been thinking I need to blog for the last two weeks Weekend before last was filled with birthday parties my coworker Anjannette turned 30 my old Editor Melinda turned 26 and another one I can t remember nice of me Went to Busby s in Santa Monica with the old intern crew from work Jorge Michelle Anjana and myself Good times and drank way way too much Got propositioned by an older Aussie guy to take a trip with him to San Francisco and surrounding areas Right like I m just going to take off with this stranger The guy I met at the Standard Will was there too and was pissed that I was dancing with some other guy the square as he called him Left me a funny message later that night which left him void of any pride he once possessed Went to eat at Bob s Big Boy after and regretted eating in the morning anyone notice a cycle Seriously drinking and eating late night is destructive to my waistline as recent times are showing Melinda s birthday was much more low key We went to Cobra Lily for tapas and sangria The food was excellent and sangria wasn t as good as the sangria at La Luna Negra Met a cool girl who works in PR gave me the low down on how all that works Always networking Last week was one of change for me I started reading this book which I have trouble putting down called Rich Dad Poor Dad It is about being financially successful and taking charge of your wealth I ve learned so much already and plan on finishing the book tonight I have quite a few more to read Smart women finish rich and another on legal tax evasion and real estate I ve realized that your profession and your business are two separate things Good since what I want to do won t pay a lot for a while not that I know exactly what that is Soul searching always leads to interesting insights about life and the world we life in This last weekend was quite packed my apartment suffered and it a mess right now Thursday night went to a Whiskey tasting event at Avalon the old Palace in LA Hate whiskey but free food and good entertainment made up for the whisky ridden martinis You could tell who just came for the free food too People were bum rushing the waitresses once they stepped out of the kitchen with a new plate of treats calm down people It s amazing how people act when something is free versus if they have to pay quality is not an issue For the first time on Thursday night I was attracted to an older man Kinda weirded me out this guy must have been 45 or 50 but there was something very sexy about him I know I m a sicko but hey it was a first We were exchanging glances all night but I was too weirded out to make myself available by stepping away from my group Friday night Michelle Claudia and I went to Clear my New bar of the week It was cool but not too exciting Good for a drink and to chat with randoms but no where I m jumping to go back to Got to wear my new top that I got from ArdenB thanks for introducing us hannah and met a guy I was so trashed More trashed that I have been in a long long while I had 4 drinks while I was there they re hard to turn down if they re free I was throwing up all night when I got home and had this job interview thingy the next morning Ya good one liz More on that later So Saturday night went out with the guy I met at Clear Stephan Ya wouldn t picture a 6 4 thick durable man now would you with a name like Stephan He s from England father Nigerian mother Brazilian Met him at his condo in Sherman Oaks then we headed to Mexicali on Ventura for dinner drinks then to the Sunset Room then to an underground after hours place and then to Jerry s long night Didn t leave his place until 6 am and nothing really happened Go me he was disappointed but hey he ll have to deal with that He treated me to everything and must of spent way too much moolaa but don t think he has to worry too much Drives a black Escalade with fancy rims don t know dimensions of which I got to drive Ya lizzie rolling on dubs around the town and then driving it around Hot very hot People kept stopping their cars next to us to look inside to see who it was very funny He owns two clothing boutiques in LA and invests in real estate Perfect for what I just started reading about what are the chances of that Problem he s 33 kinda old and has a kid Yup a 16 month old The mom is some girl he was casually sleeping with called him 4 months pregnant weren t seeing eachother anymore and he said it is up to you So he is involved in his son s life but not too heavily I think Whatever just planning on having fun for now He says he wants to take me to Vegas England etc and says that he means it I said last week I m tired of being this I ll make it on my own I need a sugar daddy Viola definitely kidding in the long run but for now cool Not sure if we ll even go out again he did call last night but we didn t connect yet We ll see Really happy for Lil She met a guy that she digs and that is way into her Keeping my fingers crossed that this is a good experience Went to this shady PR intern open house on Saturday morning Levine PR This very focused and weird guy who owns the place recruits college kids or just out of college kids to participate in his internship Internship meaning you work for him for free for 6 months and you get a letter of rec out of him He acts like he is all important but not sure really how important he is Need to make sure that a letter of rec from him would be extremely valuable and that he s not just some old fart who likes feeling all powerful over these young people who are desperate to make it in Hollywood Haven t made up my mind yet if I want to do it or not May be fun and just a good learning experience but I don t like working for free makes me feel like I m being taken advantage of He claims he will be a good mentor but not sure how involved and how much personal attention he gives to each person in mentoring their career Once again we ll see Kim s off skiing Hannah s coming home in the next two weeks and my life is rapidly changing and evolving Life is good and always keeping me on my toes Belle and I are meeting up soon too which makes me extra happy She s going to laugh so hard when she hears about my weekend Still haven t heard from Cesare Still miss him too but realize that timing was off Also still pissed that I opened my mouth and now think did I even really feel that way Was I just scared of being in a relationship bc even with Stephan I want to pull away I m not comfortable anymore being in relationships different for me Not sure why I feel this way lately Anyway I m going to give him a call in the next two weeks just to say hi and to see if he got into grad school It s been two weeks since we ve last talked and a three weeks since we broke up I ll wait another week or two until I contact him Another day at work it is already passing slowly Tonight I m going to see a room for rent in Sherman Oaks and am going to clean up my mess of an apartment Still haven t decided if I want to live in Hollywood or not Saw an apt yesterday that was cool and located on Laurel and Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood but the room is small and the closet is definitely not adequate for Lizzie but is any closet The girl who lives there seems really nice and like HGTV and TLC too Hope tonight s place is cool and that the people aren t freaks far and few between as of my late experiences If you made it to the end thanks for reading I know I blabber but now you re all caught up 

23	I think I may go into toxic shock from all the food coloring I ingested yesterday green bagel green cookies and green beer And of course to combat the crappy ness that is this morning I am drinking green tea According to my 1st grade award winning book titled The Red Rabbit I should slowly be turning green right now So far I m in the clear While celebrating St Patty s day last night it occurred to me what my biggest pet peeve is people who lag I always knew it was something I got annoyed with but damn I was going to bust last night Some guys from work invited me to go out with them to Pasadena I told them that Lil and I are going at 9 30 or so if they wanted to join us and they said We re not leaving that late Lil said she wasn t sure she wanted to go anyway so I decided to go with them I said I d be there in an hour 7 30 and that I d call when I was out front and we could leave They acted like they were going to be waiting for me so I rushed around and go there a little early Then they said oh come up for a minute we just opened another beer So I did When did we leave their place Oh 9 00 and then had to make a trip to work to pick up one guy s keys and then drove the 25 minutes to Pasadena Did we get into any bars Nope all packed Mind you during the hour and a half that we were sitting at their apartment I said twice We should get there sooner than later Forty five minutes later right before they were opening up their next beer I said I think we should leave or else were not going to get in anywhere Their response Have a beer calm down it will be fine Ya turned out just great I was in bed at 10 45 and didn t even have the beginnings of a buzz which is why I am clueless to why I feel like such crap this morning First mistake going out with only guys Second mistake actually going to Pasadena at 9 00 when I knew we weren t going to get in anywhere Damn it I could of saved 5 and been able to watch American Idol If okay when my girlfriends lag that is another story ya irritating but not to the same extreme I m not anal I m just punctual For some that makes life very difficult and for others it makes life so so much easier which one are you In my irritation last night I broke down and text messaged him Cesare Nothing big and nothing I knew I d regret doing in the morning Just a simple Happy St Patty s Day note and that was it Just want him to know that I still am thinking of him and that I still care that s all If I don t hear back that is fine but if I do he better be ready to talk I hope it s the latter 

23	Ta Dowww Like the new look Since I can t afford to do a total make over on myself I ve decided to give my blog a facelift content still the same but looks so much more hip Okay maybe not but hope you enjoy Instead of going on that date last night I spent my time at home and on the road running that is I ran more last night than I have in a long time probably about 3 miles and I walked an additional 1 5 or so I got back at about 8 30 showered and plopped in bed to let my shocked body relax It felt so good to be physically exhausted Since I don t have a gym or a man to for hours I don t get really sweaty that often I think it is probably the best thing you can do for yourself to sweat like mad at least four days a week A lot of toxins get released I m sure as well as your heart gets a work out and your bones stay strong it s been shown that resistance training helps your bones stay hard as rock No osteoporosis over here thank you very much Flat out you just feel a whole lot better Now the challenge is to remember all of this when I m sitting on the couch munching and feeling blah Get up and move Whoa I sound like a cheesy motivational speaker gross Happy St Patty s Day by the way Should be going out tonight but not sure if I m actually going to make it out I have an apartment to see at 7 so by the time I leave work get to a bar and have a drink it will be time to turn around and go see the apartment Lil and Tracy may be heading to their favorite place in Pasadena McMurphy s to party tonight It is going to be packed unless we get there early and knowing how this crew rolls out early is not likely As usual I m down for anything so we ll se what happens I ve decided that people don t dream enough Yesterday I was sitting at the lunch table with some fellow interns and the topic of your dream house came up I of course have all sorts of must haves in my baller mansion like fresh flowers tropical fruit washed and ready to eat in the fridge an endless river in the back yard etc To my surprise when I asked others they would like in their dream homes they said Uhh lots of rooms Seriously how uncreative is that Now another girl said something I totally don t resignate with I don t think about it unless I can afford it Okay but shouldn t you dream Doesn t that help drive you today so that someday that dream will be a reality Maybe this is why I m so impatient I have so many dreams in my head that I just want to get there and live them already According to the Wise Ones The success is in the journey not in the destination Not sure how much I subscribe to that but it makes sense I ve enjoyed my life thus far just want to make sure the rest in the not so friendly real world is just as good 

23	I am offically a lame ass I called Mene today to schedule the date then all of three hours later I call to cancel the same date I scheduled Can we say issues I m sorry but you need to offer to pick me up damn it Once again can we say issues I d rather stay home eat dinner watch the boob tube and go on my nightly walk then try and find Mr Right So I called as said I m not ready to date again I just ended something and think it would be a waste of both of our times at this point maybe we could reschedule in the next month or two sorry and talk to ya later Ya don t I sound very stable Oh well At least I have a night at home to myself 

23	This morning started off well with a meeting at the Disney studio and breakfast burritos on the Mouse With a full tummy I sat through the two hour meeting putting in my two cents every now and then Only had to return to the office for an hour before I was off for lunch I visited an apartment for rent in North Hollywood The apartment is nice the people living there seem cool but the area isn t too great I have another place to see tomorrow in a house off Barham so I m waiting before I make any decisions I ve promised myself that I ll move before April 1st I got slightly depressed when leaving the apartment Down by the pool were 6 perfectly bronzed twenty something girls just hanging out enjoying the So Cal sun I thought don t these people work The girl showing me the apartment was also appropriately clad in a black bikini and a little pink from her hours of laying out What a life someday I don t plan on working forever What is it with guys in southern California that insist that you meet them at their house and then they ll drive to dinner I don t get it Hello you re suppose to pick me up or we are suppose to meet somewhere Since when has this come to me mentality become standard All the gentlemen I know always insist they pick me up making the date convenient for me I am very close to calling this guy back and saying I m not interested Seriously I even tried suggesting that he either pick me up or that we meet in downtown but no he didn t get it Okay here s directions to my house and we ll leave from there Over it Last night really sucked talking to Kim was fabulous don t take offense my friend but trying to fall asleep sucked I kept thinking about you know who Cesare I just hate that I have no control over the situation even though it effects me I m mad pissed hurt hopeless hopeful just so confused I liked him a lot more that I was willing to admit to myself and now I m kicking myself for opening my fat mouth Yes I should be honest with him but now I wonder if I really felt that way Whatever I just wish we never met then I wouldn t be going through this Moving on to other people s love lives the next season of the Bachelor started last night Adam the dorky finalist from Average Joe is the new Bachelor or maybe it the new Average Joe not sure the show s title Either way this season isn t going to be half as exciting as the last couple I like watching the Bachelorette so much better bc it is full of good eye candy The only show on right now that is slightly similar is the one where the girl is trying to decipher is a guy is gay or not and then has to pick one of the eligible straight guys to win any of the money I could do that hands down I still think I have better gay dar than my gay friends I m sure they wouldn t agree I guess I need to go back to PowerPoint who I m sure is continually jealous of the attention I give to Blogger and finish up those oh so exciting process flows Operations analysis the most fundamentally boring task ever 

23	So this morning I had one of those moments where you need someone else to brief you on the day and year and your current locations I awoke at 9 40 contemplated for a couple of minutes if I was suppose to be at work or if it was Sunday checked my phone for the date then checked my calandar for the day Monday it is and late for work I am Fifteen minutes later I m out the door and headed to work which is only 5 minutes down the road 10 06 and I was at my desk now that is talent Thank god no one really noticed bc all my managers were in meetings until 10 30 so bascially a short day for me The reason for my late awake I assume I turned off my alarm in my sleep I had horrible nightmares last night and at one point remember trying to wake myself up which I did but realized I was in REM stage bc my eye balls were jittering all over the place Very strange and almost supernatural bc I was awake and remember everything yet couldn t keep my eyes open and when I did get them to open a little the room was bouncing around I laid back down and thought happy thoughts Then not too much longer I m guessing I had another not so good dream This time I vividly remember what it was about and know why I m dreaming about it So this Friday is my friend Robin Chan s birthday party At the party will be that whole circle of friends I only really see when I m at his parties or hanging out with Greg and Jeremy Most likely Cesare will be there bc Andrew will be there Remember I met Cesare at one of Robin s parties I m slightly anxious about this He may be out of town or not show up but still I m nervous So in the dream he was acting non schalant towards me was getting some sexual favors from some random girls at the bar in front of me I proceeded to through a beer on him we continued to argue I was crying he was being a typical I don t care guy and then I left the bar in tears and was surrounded by pairs of dancing cats and dogs in costume Adding to my confusion this morning I m sure I really don t get guys right now and don t get why things never work out between me and them I swear the Bailey women are cursed For example this little thing with Stephan already over I think Went out on Friday had some issues during the night and then by Sat morning he left and we haven t talked Not sure if we will or if I want to but damn can t things just be merry and work out once in a while To get away from my man issues I went to the race track on Friday with my friend Jorge and won a whopping 10 one one race that is I bet a total of 12 on two races lost both bets the first race and then won all three of my bets on the second race So I was only down in the end 2 Very fun and would love to go back on a Sat or Sun just to hang out all day eat drink and bet Definitely an interesting and diverse crowd but oh so exciting Still looking for a new place to live have coffee with two girls on Friday to see if they want me in their apt going to see another tomorrow afternoon and wrote another this morning Keep your fingers crossed To Kim s point hormones are just fabulous I too was PMSing last week and life did seem just a slightly darker shade of gray I tried to make it a little brighter by buying ice cream wheat thins and cheese at the market didn t help too much but for the 10 minutes I was enjoying that rocky road nothing could bring me down This weekend I also realized what it meant to be ridiculous At the charity auction a 8 week old chocolate lab went at the live auction for 9 000 Yup you can buy a pure bread for 600 Money to toss around I guess at least it was for a charity Tax ride off I m sure Guy probably owns his own business That was just one of the many ridiculous bids Another was for a modern sculpture that was basically an old used bicycle seat on a rod that went for 1700 named Lone Rider It wasn t even by a famous artist I m still devouring every financial planning book I can get my hands on in hopes that I will become financially stable I will in time first step lower rent Next step higher paying job Third step investment portfolio building Oh so exciting I know 

23	This is the first time I have blogged from home Usually a much needed brake from all too often mundane work leads me to blog at the office what a good employee I guess I was compelled to write bc I haven t conversed with anyone today except Jules about 5 minutes ago For the last week I ve been pretty sick cold cough etc so I ve been trying to recoup today by laying in bed lifeless and mindless which has left me feeling like a useless waste of space So I figure actually doing something slightly productive like writing even if it s rambling will get my Brain to do a little work today It s hard to write though bc I keep getting interrupted with coughing fits I don t know what my left lung has against me but it wants OUT I ve been taking Alieve Cold n Fly coupled with Cough medicine I keep forgetting when I took each dose so I just take another dose when I start feeling drippy again It says on the package only take 1 every 12 hours well I take one every 8 hours or so Should I be worried If I turn up blue in the face somewhere you all know why I O D on cold medicine During my lifeless afternoon laying in bed I was watching some show on women who all go to this house to try and change or accomplish something they are struggling with One of the life coaches brought up a good point you have to focus to succeed and you have to have a clear idea of what you want Duh right Then I realized no wonder nothing in my life right now is going anywhere It starts then ends Everything from dating to new career ambitions to my lifestyle to my dreams I just haven t figured out yet what it is that I want more than everything else for myself Who I want to be is pretty clear but what I want to do and what is going to make me the happiest isn t clear Timing just isn t right yet for me to be extremely prolific I need more time to sort out what I want to focus on and then I have no doubts that I will give it my all to make it happen I just hope I figure out exactly what that is sooner than later I m not talking about what I inevitably want to do with myself but right now what do I want to do What would that lead to or what opportunities does that open up and how do I get there More thinking and self discovery Someday I m sure I ll look back and think who would of thunk I need to take a first step before I can cross the finish line I guess I m scared of taking the wrong first step but hey any step is better than just standing there I can always turn around or change directions I may get my feet pretty tangled for a while but with time they ll get it I hope Speaking of getting my feet tangled up tonight despite the cold I m going salsa dancing Watch out now I m wearing my salsa shoes the ones with a red flower on the toe very cute if I may say so and some outfit that hides my growing waist line damn trail mix I realize that I shouldn t be going bc I m sick but I ve been promising my coworker Jenna for months and I mean months that I d go with her I ve canceled twice and so this time I refuse to be a flake I have a feeling that there will be a lot of older sweaty men dancing circles around me but I ll go and give it a try She s 32 and her friends I m assuming are the same age or older so this should be interesting Hopefully I don t bust out coughing while some wana be ricky martin is spinning me in circles That would be embarrassing and gross I ll be sure to take a couple shots of Robitussin before I leave Alcohol and cold medicine isn t a good mix I m sure I ll just be sure to take it easy on the drinks 

23	For anyone who needs a good laugh this morning here ya go Every morning I have green tea and a handful of nuts for breakfast This morning however I was out of tea so I opted for coffee Usually I have a large cup of tea but for coffee I use a small cup trust me this will become relevant I place the handful of nuts is a small cup so that I can pour them out into my hand throughout the morning While being completely distracted reading Kim s blog very funny and I feel for ya Kim I reached for my cup o nuts Instead I grabbed the cup of coffee about 1 3 full and proceeded to throw it all over myself I usually kinda toss the nuts around in the cup so I can choose which one I want this time I tossed coffee all over myself I sat at my desk covered in coffee realizing that I mistook the small cup of coffee for the small cup of nuts My manager walked by and after a good chuckle said Why don t you go home and change So that was the start to my morning My cube still reakes of coffee Let s hope the rest of the day doesn t follow it s tune 

23	Another day at the office one short from yesterday though One of our interns got fired yesterday At 4 00 they had a meeting and by 5 00 she was gone with her desk cleaned out I feel bad for her That has got to be traumatizing and it follows you for the rest of your life You got fired You didn t quit didn t get laid off didn t move on they didn t want you and bad enough that they got rid of you immediately Almost like you are a threat to the company Funny once when I worked at the magazine our publisher went ballistic and was firing our Graphics guy He went in there yelling Step away from the machines Don t touch anything Leave remember that Kim That was frightening and only about 3 weeks after I started working there Funny now scary then Speaking of the magazine I am writing two article for them for the April issue I just finished one and sent it to my friend Kim to edit before anyone else see it and thank God I did I totally lost my touch There were so many edits and good ones at that I have forgotten how to write Well for magazines anyway You have to be direct specific and entertaining Thanks for the help Kim I ll be sending another your way when I finish it Just ten minutes ago I got a call from my coworker Melissa we went though the internship program together and now both are casual employees She said that a friend of hers has an opening as an Assistant Buyer for TJ Max and was wondering if I was interested Heck ya I ve always thought that would be fun to pick out what gets sold in stores I hear that if you re good you can make bank and it is quite a glamorous job but if you re not good you re unemployed permanently So a gamble but why not give it a try This could also lead to a Category Manager position if the buyer thing doesn t work out or I don t like it Have no idea if they d even consider me since I don t have experience but I think she s going to put in a good word so they give me a try Keep your fingers crossed not sure about the details but change can be very exciting

23	Finally the cold is subsiding Last night was the first in many that I actually slept the whole night without getting up to blow my nose cough up something or pee When my alarm went off I was like Yes finally a full night s sleep I did it This morning I don t feel anymore alert than usual though funny how that works Last night I made up for my lazy sick week I was hyper productive Besides finishing my second article for Options magazine which was like pulling teeth to write I vacuumed did the dishes cleaned out half of my shoes went on a power walk and cooked like mad I don t know what it was but I just couldn t sit down I felt so antsy Overall I was really impressed with my cooking abilities Usually when I get home I draw a blank when it comes to preparing something for dinner A sandwich canned soup really that s it all I eat or cook But last night I was determined to clean out my freezer before the move which inspired me to become creative I made lemon caper chicken curry chicken marsala and my most proud concoction a spinach shrimp and rice bisque Just tried a spoon full of this one and it seemed tasty we ll see how it really is this afternoon at lunch I guess I realized I m not as much of a cooking degenerate as I thought there is hope Yesterday I filled out the application for the Apprentice I love that show and think it would be fun to be on it Unfortunately I think I m past the deadline The web site says semi finalist interviews are March and April but then they are holding open calls this weekend across the country not in LA though so wouldn t that mean if I send my tape in by mid next week then I d make it Not sure may still try but also may just wait until next season The probability of actually getting on the show is so low and they re probably looking for super model type girls and that is definitely not me but it is worth a shot Whether it s this season or next I will be applying for The Apprentice A coworker of mine has offered to set me up with one of his friends This is the same coworker that set me up with that guy that I thought was sooo great over the phone and when we met in person it just wasn t there at all This time however I ve seen the guy he wants to set me up with and introduced myself Definitely cute and graduated from USC with his MBA so I know he is motivated and hopefully has a good job future in front of him We ll see I m not sure if David suggested we hang out or if this guy asked if I d want to hang out Who knows but I hope he was the one inquiring I m sending a shout out to Kim this morning Sorry for your blah day those suck Just remember you can use these three years for the rest of your life to make George do anything you want you ve paid your dues Hang in there One more thing I m seriously contemplating do the Atkins diet Not psycho carb a phobic method but just trying to eat few carbs I learned at that health lunch I went to that your body burns carbs first fat second and protein last So if I eat too many carbs my body doesn t get to my fat storage for feul I guess the key is then low fat protein and veggies Working out will just expedite the process of burning this layer of fat that is becoming thicker by the week Don t want to be super skinny by any means just want to be very comfortable wearing shorts being naked etc I don t want to fully subscribe yet to trying this but it s on my mind for sure 

23	The Date I met Julien at his house in Pasadena at 7 30 kinda in a shady alcove with other random houses but whatever Just to be safe the night before on the phone I asked him what the attire was He said that the attire wasn t a cocktail dress but so I wore a black skirt pink and black tank top and a black blazer with heals thinking no jeans He compared the attire to a freakin cocktail dress for goodness sakes When I showed up there was definitely a little bit of an awkward uh you re over dressed or I m under dressed moment but we got over it He wasn t wearing jeans but nothing I wouldn t wear to school on an everyday basis After a glass of wine at his place and a quick chat we went to dinner at a really nice place in Pasadena called Cafe Bizoux a french place Did I mention he is French from Paris actually He s only been in the States for 5 years yet he has no accent bummer The food was great and the ambiance even better Conversation is always good and never stops Didn t find out anything bad about him and on paper he is great In person good but he s a little more animated and dorky than I d really like but hey maybe he was nervous During dinner he had to use the restroom and excused himself While he was gone an old man came by and was admiring the paintings behind me We chatted for a brief moment then he returned to his seat A moment later Julien came back to the table About five minutes after he returned the old man came back over to our table leaned in toward Julien and wispered You know she s too good for you right Holy crap I almost died Julien said Ya I know that trust me Whoa that was funny I just laughed Is it normal for strangers to come interupt your date especially with a comment like that Anywho after dinner we headed to the Ritz Carlton to get drinks I offered to pay for the drinks bc he paid for dinner and he let me I guess that s what I get I was hoping he wouldn t let me but that s fine Again good conversation and being that this was our 3 drink each conversation was a little less philosophical and more racy A great thing about him is that he isn t shy one bit about sex or anything like that and I definitely find that attractive I m pretty sure he d been good in the sack Anyhow here comes the kicker what s been off setting since the date After drinks we decided to walk around the hotel bc it is just that beautiful Along the hallways there are antique dressers with plants and vases on them He proceeded to open the drawers and snoop around in them I m kinda like okay kinda weird but moving on Then we pass by a little phone booth In the booth is a notepad and pen with the Ritz Carlton seal on it He goes in the phone booth and takes some of the paper and puts it in his pocket and says I could always use some nice Ritz notepad paper I m always running out of notepads How TACKY can you be It is one thing if you are staying there and you take the notepaper in the room it is another thing to be roaming the halls to try and find free things to take that say Ritz on them Not impressed I didn t know what the hell to say so I just stood there shocked Moving on we went back to his house He asked if I d like to come in and I said that I needed to get home it was 12 30 bc I had to work early in the day He walked me to my car gave me a kiss on the cheek and said he d like to see me again I said sure that next week would be good So overall good guy cute polite and respectable but not so sure on the notepad thing That really threw me off at least don t do that on a first date later whatever but try and not be a klepto right off the bat Then driving home I stopped to get a donut Not sure why Haven t had one in months and just felt like something tasty There this old guy buying donuts said to me You look nice but you wont look that good in 20 years if you keep eating donuts What the hell okay thanks for the advice I replied Thanks for the advice but I don t do this every night Then he offered to buy my donut Weirdo Then heading back to my car these two guys hanging out smoking tried to pick up on me What he hell I m buying donuts at 12 30 in the morning how can that be attractive and I m not skinny so even more reason it wouldn t be attractive FYI donut shops seem to be the new pick up spots for young people Very strange evening overall I can t wait I m flying home tomorrow and I get to see the pups and my kitty way too excited to get away and have cable TV Ahhh no more golf on Saturday morning it s the little things isn t it

23	Happy Easter to all that celebrated Hope is was full of chocolate and visiting with family not in that order of course I had a nice long weekend at home I think I ate out every meal except for breakfast Thursday through Sunday and managed to make sure I sampled every chocolate egg within my reach throughout the weekend On Friday morning I almost killed out older dog Lily she s 10 yrs old I decided that I was going to hike the near by mountain name Mission Peak which is about a moderately strenuous 2 hour hike up and hour hike down running most of the way down bc it is so steep I took both dogs thinking they d like the walk and exercise Chloe was fine Lily barely made it We go to within 100 yards of the top and Lily just stopped She couldn t carry her fat butt one more step So we sat they drank my water and we rested with the top in plain view Two middle aged fitness America types ran by muscles bulging and smiling ear to ear Whoa talk about endorphins Anyway we headed back down and met my mom at the base Good exercise and makes me miss the beauty of the Bay Area The rest of the day I was pretty out of it and until I ate dinner at Red Lobster I had a stomach ache Good news my butt upper butt that is was so sore the next day Ya The part that lunges don t work out I need more hills to climb damit Anywho Easter was good The food was even better Nice to be home but know why I couldn t live there kinda sad bc I can see my mom getting older and the house starting to fall apart Too much for one person to take care of Makes me want to move back and help out but that s not going to happen anytime too soon I really felt like Fremont and the whole Bay Area in general was such a sleepy town when I was home I guess it is just so much different from LA the whole pace of the city is different and you know what I missed it I missed LA Never thought I d say that Guess times are changing 

23	Good news kinda I just found out that I got a raise only 2 which is barely nothing But the extra money per month will help me save just a touch more when I start saving that is 

23	Twenty something issues as running sweating Again it seems as if the planets are just not aligned correctly All my friends seem to be going through some kind of emotionally trying time including myself Confusion about what to do with ourselves confusion about relationships with men or women and confusion about careers confusion about where to live and most of all confusion on what really is going to make us happy I guess it just comes with the time beginning our lives outside of school Fortunately for my friends hundreds of doors are open to them they just have to choose and figure out which one they want to open Sometimes it is harder to have to pick than to have only one option Either way we all want to be successful we all want to be financial stable and then some we all want a job we re passionate about we all want to be happy and we all want to be surrounded by the people we love It seems so hard to get all this to balance out I guess you work most of your life toward getting this all to work making decisions good and bad and then learning from them I personally just feel like I m sitting in Limbo Nothing really is going on but at the same time I can see opportunities they re just not being activated I feel stuck like I go from box to box apartment to cube at work and back Once again my dreamer quality is persuading me to make decisions that I shouldn t be making I e living in a nicer apartment but not saving any money I swear I just want it all Nothing wrong with that but at the same time I need to realize that I m not going to have it ALL right now it is something that I have to work towards Saving money getting a better job getting a better place to live finding good roommates etc Uh I m am my father s daughter no patience what so ever Here s a shout out to all my ladies that are confused and frustrated with life Someday it will all make sense and we WILL have it ALL 

23	PERFECT Good laugh A teacher asked her class What do you want out of life A little girl in the back named Lizzie raised her hand and said All I want out of life is four animals The teacher asked Really And what four animals would that be The little girl replied a Mink on my back a Jaguar in the garage a Tiger in my bed and a Jackass to pay for it all The teacher fainted 

23	Wow it has been a while for me since I ve written When there aren t many entries it means I m actually busy at work and will be getting more busy very soon I think about blogging when I m at home but since I ve disconnected my home phone line I no longer have internet service By mid next month I plan to have my home operation up and running I think I ve figured out why I like to blog why I want my own web site and why I just love to surf the net It makes me feel heard and connected I get to live in this world where I think people actually read what I have to say and enjoy hearing about what I m doing or thinking The good thing is that I ll never know that only a handful if that read my blog therefore allowing me to pretend that I am some profound writer with a following While I know that isn t true it fun to pretend Ah a little piece of me that doesn t have to face reality and just pretend the world is how I imagine it This weekend I ran in the Nike Run Hit Wonder Race 5k just over 3 miles I did a lot better than I thought 27 minutes flat and once again got in touch with my competitive side I miss racing I plan on signing up for other 5ks around the area and maybe even travel to a few Eventually maybe I ll try a 10k 6 miles but I ve never raced such a long distance Run 6 miles yes raced 6 miles no Two different things I tell you My friends I went with did well and came in at around 33 minutes They ran together I planned on running with them but then that competitive thing kicked in and I just had to try and challenge myself I kept picking on person in front of me to pass then after passing them I picked another then another etc The best motivation though was on the 3rd mile the last stretch Tone Loke sp was singing Hotel Motel Holiday Inn and I just got the biggest smile on my face and took off I love music It just makes me want to move and is an instant energy booster There were several other bands along the way but none that I new all one hit wonders See the connection now Overall a great Sunday When I got home at 10 30 a m I slept for almost the rest of the day I had only gotten 2 hours of sleep the night before had a minor hangover in the morning and hadn t been hydrating as much as I usually do I was tore up so I slept then ate then slept then ate I thought to myself so this is the life of a cat not bad Today I am having lunch with one of my manager s friends who works in marketing for Disney I expressed to him my interest and he helped me set up a lunch meeting with her to discuss marketing in general how to get into the field and what positions if any Disney has to offer me Just trying to get somewhere not sure where I m going or where I ll eventually end up but might as well take advantage of every opportunity that passes by My other manager Greg has a friend who works for the History Channel and A E He said he d hook me up with his friend to discuss opportunities in producing always been interested but haven t heard from him yet Keeping my fingers crossed Whatever I do I must have the ability to be inventive to be challenged it must have some sort of prestige that s just me and I must enjoy it Working with good people are a huge factor as well but that I feel is more luck than anything JP my old boss has also set me up with one girl in PR and another guy in marketing for Warner Brothers All of these meetings are just informal interviews i e me asking them about what they do Not job opportunities but you never know when a position will open up Like I said just fishing around for a fit I guess we all are and we will continue to search until we find the perfect job Not that I think the perfect job exists but definitely something a little closer than what I do now would be good 

23	We had the talk my manager and I that is It went well nothing huge but kinda good news for me She apologized for not making sure I was getting the best projects and that she would make sure to give me the most interesting and challenging projects that grace her desk For the past couple of months she has be delegating most of the projects to inters and a few to me I think she realized that she should be making sure my plate is full then going to interns to help fill in the blanks She also said that with this next round of interns starting in July that I will be able to manage one and have them support me Awesome I get to put management experience on my resume While I m not getting a big raise or getting full time privileges I will be getting better work Thank god bc I was beginning to go nuts I think they all could tell I wasn t stoked to be here well less stoked than I used to be She also told me that I need to let her know when I m bored feeling unchallenged or whatever so that she can try and find better projects for me to work on Deal I guess in the past I didn t want to highly publicize the fact that I didn t really have too much work to do Now however I know she supports me and wants me to have a good experience AMEN Happy Cinco De Mayo I hope everyone has a chance to down a few margaritas and eat some yummy Mexican food Some work ladies and myself are heading to a Mexican restuarante for lunch ahh just when I was going to start eating healthy Which brings me to my next point my ass and waistline are growing out of control For the last month I haven t been eating too well I ve been exercising but not enough to catch up to my calorie intake I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I ve just been feeling depressed lately and am trying everything including eating to feel better Obviously long term this just makes things worse So I m trying hard to turn over a new leaf This morning I went on a 2 mile walk I had nuts for breakfast and at lunch today will try to get fajitas and mainly just eat the meat I need to stay away from the chips Same old battle and the saga continues I am excited for tonight however good TV The bachelor followed by a 2 hour dateline friends special Good news since the last two nights TV has sucked and honestly I ve just been to lazy to find other things to do I have dishes that are overflowing in my sink and an ass to walk run off so don t ask me why I just sit there But like I said I m trying to turn over a new leaf or go back to a previous leaf Good times Yesterday was the best mail day in a long time I got my federal tax return in the mail Now I can finally after waiting for 9 months go buy a laptop I plan on saving some of the money but a large portion of it is going towards my new system I can t wait With this new computer I m getting wireless internet another cost but worth it I think Although until I save more money I may just be going to the local Starbucks or Barns and Noble to use there internet they are hot spots meaning they have wireless internet servers for free Along with this new device will come my own web page hopefully I ve been wanting to build one forever so with my spare time instead of watching TV I hope to get that up and running You may see a picture of you worried yet For now I m out Oh ya I m applying for a job in Toronto Canada aye 

23	This morning I was suppose to have a meeting with my head manager I was both nervous and hopeful about what the meeting would reveal Every other time we ve had one of these coffee and update kinda of meetings it has had to do with job situation So this could be really good news really bad news or cautionary news Maybe she is trying to get a feel for how I m liking the job that is a definitely possibility I haven t exactly been the usual chipper Lizzie lately and people are starting to notice One of my managers took me into his office and just flat out asked Is everything okay I guess my mood is just reflected in my demeanor probably I m not happy is written all over my face They think it is work related which it partly is but it mainly is just me making that transition to the real world and growing up more and more each day A sad face once in a while is what happens when you go from an absolutely fabulous life in college to the 8 5 working world in a new place with no familiarity Anyway my point is that we didn t have the meeting She is running late this morning bc her son had to go to the doctors Now I sit here wondering just what was she going to say Hopefully I ll find out soon once we reschedule For the 3rd time last night I tried rearranging my furniture so that the TV was not the main focus I find that since every chair and my bed points to the TV so all I do when I sit anywhere is want to watch TV I want a little area just for reading then a sleeping area and then a place for my TV where you can see it from everywhere but it isn t the focus I ve decided that this layout is just not possible I have moved my bed 3 times my chairs my dresser everything has moved and nothing looks as good as the way it does now At least I got some exercise in and came to the realization to just stop moving things Once I decorate a little more and nest further then I hope I ll feel more at home Not much you can do with on square room or at least I m just not creative enough to think of anything fancy to do with a studio Seriously though if this is one of the things concerning me I better re evaluate what is serious and what isn t 

23	What a weekend I took Amtrak down to San Diego to visit Kim and the fam bam It never fails to be a very relaxing and fun time We ate hiked shopped talked walked and SAT AROUND Ah what a life I m not sure what it is about Ramona Kim s house or whatever it is that makes visiting so relaxing but it is The fabulous company has a lot to do with it I know but there is something about the environment that is just so soothing With all this time to relax of course my head is going on dream mode I ve come up with a new idea I ve decided that I m going to look into buying land Where you ask Saskatchewan Canada you bet I had to look that up for the right spelling Why because no one lives there land is cheap and I m sure very pretty I think it would be so cool just to say that you own a little piece of Canada Who knows maybe someday I ll built a resort on it and market the place as a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of California New York or other busy places I do need to find out however if I have to pay property tax just to own the land If I do well that idea may be out for now but we ll see I m nuts I know but it is at least fun to think about I ve realized something this weekend LA isn t good for me It makes me really greedy and greedy for the wrong things For fancy cars and prestige and a big elaborate house and jewlry and fame etc When I m away from LA and just relaxing I focus on other things like personal fullfilment and enjoying nature and keeping my body healthy Of course I still want a fancy car a nice house and all the options someone with moola has but not to the same extreme I feel less pressured and rushed to get there when I m not in LA My mom has told me during my more frequent break downs that I will drive myself crazy if I keep stressing myself out I put so much pressure on myself to succeed be rich and do something significant that I get panicked that I won t do it in time or that I will never do it to the capacity that I want to I m a dreamer we all know that But I tend to dream 10 times bigger than the average person with no idea of how I m actually going to accomplish my dreams There aren t specific like write a children s book about they are more on the lines of write something a good non fiction book a documentary a children s book start a magazine etc It is hard to get going if you one person want to go in 5 directions I figure something will prompt me to go in one direction and things will then all fall into place But I m really really worried that this will not happen and at 50 I ll be sitting in some cube thinking the same thing I need to realize that I have to take control of my life and my destiny and not wait for the right sign for it to unfold Then again I am way impatient and sometimes push things when I should let them happen on their own Ah balance again comes into place Funny how I ve never really mastered it Even more funny how I wrote my college entrance essays on how I ve learned to balance my life between all my activities What a liar or naive to the fact that I had little to balance Everything was taken care of I just had to attend I had not bills no boss no future to direct it was all taken care of for me Funny how you look back and realize how easy life was even though it didn t seem easy I m sure I ll think the same thing one day when I have a family and career Blah enough for now I m just dreaming of getting home eating dinner and into my PJs right now That seems like a good goal for today I ll add in exercise and a little reading and I m good for today 

23	Today is a better day Not sure why Maybe the exercise last night helped I felt really shitty after I worked out but my mood has been better today I really think the people factor in my life is the biggest component to my happiness which sucks bc that makes me dependent on others for my happiness indirectly But that s me I purchased renter s insurance It costs me little a month and I m covered up to 10 000 if the place was to burn down if there was a massive earth quake or for whatever reason things get damaged with my place Heck even if I spill water on my lap top they pay to fix it If I have a friend over and they slip crack their head open the insurance covers their medical bills Why not Better be safe than sorry I guess My dad convinced me to get it Last night I finally after many trials and tribulations bought a lap top I ve been wanting one for about 10 months now but couldn t afford it until the good old US Gov gave me back some of the money they take every day I started off at Best Buy which according to my research has the best base price amongst all computer stores On Monday they were out of the lap top I wanted They said on Wed they d have two more in I went in last night don t have any never got any in So SOL the Best Buy girl was realy nice and sent me to Comp USA where she knew some people They price match with Best Buy so I wouldn t be at a loss for moola They were out At this point I m thinking this just isn t meant to be The in my last effort I headed across the street to Circuit City Tada they had ONE left and it was the same price as Best Buy so no price issues there I happily walk up the counter the cashier rings me up takes my Debt card and says Sorry your card has been denied WHAT Could something else make this process even more difficult I know I had enough to cover and then some in my account So I called the bank I guess even on debit cards that is a limit I had no idea I thought it was like a check But then again I haven t ever tried to spend as much money at one time as I did last night So they filled out some form and raised my limit to the amount I needed and all was good Thank god I had previously bought the software I needed from Costco hauled everything upstairs to my apartment and played with my new toy my long awaited for toy It was fun but I need the internet which is a whole nother expense I m working that out this afternoon I was content last night Playing with my computer and watching the 2 hour bachelor special I had other issues to deal with that night but this morning I cleared my head and said Today is a new day Maybe that s why my attitude it better I just am tired of feeling shitting and blah No doubt I still have issues to get over but that is an ongoing thing For now I feel better No idea what tomorrow or lunch time will bring but now is good and that is what is important 

23	So today I ve had some spare time and thought I should research a little bit about depression I don t know much about it well besides the obvious But I ve never felt so down for such a long period of time I guess I m wondering if I need to see someone for help if this is something I can get over or if this is normal and just a passing phase My research shows that depression not sadness must be for a period of longer than two weeks That the normal tasks you use to do now seem impossible to do Feeling zapped of energy constantly being tired and sleeping a lot are all signs as well Changes in weight up or down are also signs as well as withdrawing from friends and family So after reading this I think I more than just sad I m depressed Not sure why what caused it or how I m going to get out of this Which leads me to my next point on the same web site there is a test that is suppose to let you know if you should see a doctor I took it and according to the test I need to see a doctor Just great I figure I need to deal with these same feelings that keep surfacing making me feel crapy This time however I m not in my prime of life loving my situation so it isn t easy to distract myself with friends school parties etc So in my closing remarks I will say the last month or so not so great but that s okay bc hopefully I will learn how to get over these feelings and issues I have that I have had for a while so that this doesn t happen again If it does well maybe I ll have some tools to better cope Until next time 

23	This will be short we have a staff meeting in just a few minutes Things have been better since my last blog Not by too much but I feel like the dark cloud that was sitting over my head has now turned into a fog I m trying to make mini improvements in my life of the things that I can control I think it helps too that I ll be off to Chico this weekend to visit Belle and to celebrate her graduation and birthday I miss her She thinks I should come stay with her for at least a week this summer and just hang out She ll only be working about 15 hours a week and will have an extra room While I don t think taking a vacation for a week will happen I definitely need to spend more time with the people who know me and love me for who I am Which is also why I think I m feeling better Spending consecutive weekends with family and with close friends have made me realize just how fabulous my friends and family are I just wish they all lived down the street and not 2 to 6 hours away At least they in driving distance which makes little weekend trips possible Things are also looking up bc I ve found some jobs online that I actually want to apply for I was looking for a while and didn t even really seen any that I really wanted Now I m finding jobs in every market that I consider entering All I have to do now it start writing those cover letters and applying we ll see Ta Ta for now 

23	It s Saturday night and I m sitting on my bed typing away I ve become addicted to my laptop ever since I got it I never knew being on the computer could be so convenient and comfortable If you know me you are probably questioning why I m home on Sat night rare bc I usually feel obligated to be out and about every weekend night not that I have anywhere fabulous to go Lately though I ve been becoming more of a home body Ever since my spat with myself I just like being home and comfortable Am I over the party constantly phase Could the adult you must grow up now phase really settling in I hope not I hope it is just a hiatus I ve come to some good realizations lately Some may just be from being sick and tired of being unhappy others maybe from age and experience They say as you get older you become a lot more comfortable with who you are and a lot less worried about what others think I m getting there I m realizing that I m not so bad the way I am even with the long list of improvements I have running through my head I need to be content and happy with who I am Not what pants size I wear today vs last month or how many Hershey Kisses I ve grabbed out of the bowl while walking to my cube That isn t important in the long run All temporary But who I am is forever Changes occur of course but the core of what I m about what makes me smile deep down and how I feel when I m around those who know me better than I know myself will never change Life isn t bad it s just not easy My opinion If you always take the easy road life won t be that rewarding I figure it is when we challenge ourselves that a sense of true accomplishment is felt Everyday presents new challenges new temptations and new rewards I guess you just have to fight the little battles and then one day you ll wake up and Victory will be declared I can t wait for that day That day when I can say I did it I can t believe I did it It is nothing in particular Maybe it s getting that job I ve had my eye on or fitting into my favorite jeans or heck even just being content with where I am in life I ve been so rushed to prove something to who I don t know But you know what I have a full life in front of me to accomplish things I need to focus on today first and then before I know it 100 tomorrows later I ll have made some real progress I guess like everyone else I want my life to be great It will be if I try hard to make me great then my life will be great I have to be with myself 24 hrs 7 days I might as well like me I m working on that could be working harder at it but I m getting there Ah the joys of growing up and coming into your own Hannah gave me a card once that really says it all Life is not about finding yourself life is about CREATING yourself Amen

23	Last night was a first A first of many things The first time I have gone to a bar where women take off their clothes and the first time I was propositioned with money to dance on stage This all sounds worse that it really was Last night Michelle took me Forty Deuce a bar with cabaret show The shows are pretty innocent and are more of about acrobatics and seduction It is the club where Jessica Simpson had Nick s birthday party and where she came out of the cake So after the first strip show the DJ started blaring the music once again and the crowd was pumped all the hormones were now raging Funny cause before the show people were pretty mellow and then after damn guys and girls alike were getting out of control So of course some girls jumped up on stage bar to dance and seduce They were not sexy at all But they thought they were so I guess that is what is important Right This girl who I didn t know at all and haven t even casually talked to asks me to go up and dance on the bar I politely said No bc I didn t want to be a sheep and join the flock of wana bee performers She began to beg and beg and try to get guys to drag me up there After several Nos she busted out cash and starts counting off money to get me up there While it was only 25 bucks still I had never been proposition like that I kept pointing out other people she should take up there and she said and I quote No I want you Whoa there chicky at that point I backed up and she moved on onto the stage that is It was a cool place No where I d go back just to go out but definitely a good place to take out of towners or first timers Best to make reservations so you don t have to stand the whole time FYI Life is good right now Finally got a little kitchen table so I can stop eating dinner on the floor had my phone interview which went well hopefully will get promoted in three months going home in August for the five year reunion and a tip to Tahoe with Dad and Janice his girlfriend for a little vacation Rest of the weekend I ll be running errands and researching for my article due the 20th I ll keep writing for the extra income each month but once I make more money then I think I ll be more selective on which articles I write as in the ones that don t involve contacting ten people and coordinating interviews and artwork Anyway A day and a half more to enjoy before I m back at work 

23	I was violated last night Yup I got a computer virus I was downloading Kazaa software off the internet so I could download music like many of my friends do and all of a sudden things stopped working Long story short when you don t pay and you download the software then it comes with spyware This way these advertisers can see what web sites you go to so they can send you junk mail and the sort So today a guy at work is helping me rid my computer of this violation It was weird though I was so irate I couldn t sleep very well and just couldn t believe that people spend their time writing programs that mess up strangers computers What the hell get a life Hopefully by tonight when I run Norton again it will come back clean and my computer will be healthy again I didn t spend that much money to have some nerd destroy it Anyway my advice be careful while on the Net and while I m sure you have Norton anti virus make sure you update it weekly if not daily Good news I have a phone interview scheduled for Thursday with ACNielsen When I talked this morning with the a guy who works for them he really revealed what I d actually be doing and what the growth and career path potential is I think it is definitely something that would be great for me and ties to what I m interested in consumer behavior More good news In my department one our my co workers left on maternity leave and my old boss which was her boss as well pulled me into her office to tell me that I am her first choice to take her position is she doesn t come back after the baby is born We both don t think she is coming back afterwards so good news for me She was 29 now I a 23 yr old get her position Ya Man that rocks I hope the pay does too Totally jumping ahead of myself but just forward thinking I came to another realization last night I don t want to leave L A I feel like I m not done yet like I haven t exhausted my options and my opportunities I keep randomly applying for jobs all over the country but I need to stop bc if offered one I don t know if I d say no and I don t want to leave Make sense Anyway I like it here I like that there are a million things to do I like that there are all sorts of people I like that there are always new places to go I like the weather ah I just like it Vacations are definitely needed to remember that the rest of the world isn t this fast paced but for now I m happy here I d like to live with friends and maybe more centrally located not so far east in LA but besides that I m good Today anyway 

23	You know when you have those weekends that are busy but then on Monday you have no idea what you did I felt that way this morning extremely foggy headed Last week as ridiculously busy this week so far is dead I have a major headache right now so I don t mind the quite cube Some of you knew that I was doing the south beach diet for the last two weeks What promised to be a weight loss of 8 to 13 pounds ended up being 4 pounds in two weeks in which all of it was regained this weekend when I drank one night and munched all day one day Mostly water weight I m sure but I ve been educating myself to the Nth degree on weight calories studies on weight loss and the like Any questions I know it all Doesn t mean I can loose weight successfully I m suppose to go run tonight with the LArunning group I belong to but I m not going This headache and I are going to lay in bed and watch Ryan Seacrest until I feel better Running later maybe but not after work I ve been feeling distant lately from my friends I feel like summer has brought busy times but strangely I m getting really used to being alone I don t necessarily mind it but I m used to it Life is quiet right now I called a guy I went on a date with about 2 months ago on Saturday The French guy who took the notepad from the Ritz I just had this urge and feeling like I should call him like I cut things off too soon or something So I did He said he was pleased that I called we chatted and I said call me later this week if you want to chat or get drinks We ll see if he calls not sure how I feel about it if he does but whatever at least I got that urge out of my system I visited my friend Nichole this weekend She was once a coworker of mine and is having a baby tomorrow I can t believe it I ve known her since she got pregnant it is amazing what can happen in such a short amount of time a human is created Wow She s great and so lucky Her husband is fabulous and her house is gorgeous and she has a new BMW a rock on her finger and a healthy little girl on the way I m pretty sure she isn t going to be working after Stella the baby is born so that means possible full time job for me We ll see Nichole deserves the fabulous life she has bc she is pretty freakin great another good role model for me I am blessed with a lot of older really great role models JP Kim and Nichole Maybe being 27 29 isn t so bad Please pray for those that are struggling right now Life isn t easy and demands persistence and perseverance My favorite quote After winter must come Spring Lauryn Hill 

23	What a week It s been a good one a little stressful but good Every night since Tuesday I ve been out and about the way I like to do it Dinner then clubbing for Hannah s b day then to a bar bc I was feeling frisky then on a date which was realllly boring then out last night clubbing and tonight down to Orange Country for Julie s bday and tomorrow off to Shavonne s 4th of July BBQ Gotta love busy weekends Last night was particularly funny though Michelle and I went to dinner at the Hollywood and Highland complex and were suppose to go out with her roommate and friend to some club Well they ended up deciding to stay home so after dinner Michelle and I thought we d just stop by Level 3 a club by the restaurant just to check it out have a few drinks and people watch But we were only going to go if we didn t have to pay I had e mailed the manager on Wed for Hannah s bday and he wrote back that we should come on Friday So Michelle and I walked up leftovers from dinner in our hands and I talked to the door girl and said I had talked to Dave and he told us to come on Friday She being the most bubbly and bouncy girl I have ever met hopped off to find Dave Great Dave doesn t know who the hell I am just some Joe Schmoe who e mailed him Anyway long story short the girl lets us in before everyone else bc we re now Dave s friends we don t pay and our IDs and bags aren t even checked After one drink one of the promoters befriended us while we were waiting outside for Dave came buy and brought us each two more drinks and a shot of some new type of Vodka We sat drank and danced The club wasn t that great but my point of this long boring story is that it s amazing how people perceive you just by how you look and what you say If you act like you re important people think you re important All you have to do in life is talk to people and opportunity will be knocking at your door Anyway we were laughing about it when we left bc we went there knowing no one and left with everyone treating us like royalty bc we supposedly were Dave s friends hey whatever works 

23	I m back back from the date with the English man I sit here in bed thinking not sleeping so I figure I ll write and reflect on my thoughts Warning I ve had quite a few drinks Who knows how honest rude or self deprecating this blog will be but here we go I need to start being more selective in accepting offers for dates I usually figure nice guy what could be so bad Dinner drinks new experiences I ll go Tonight though I m reminded of those dates where even with the excellent food and free entertainment I d rather be home sitting on my rear watching Blind Date or Access Hollywood than out with some guy The English man was nice and polite until the third drink then he started getting a little too frisky at the restaurant I m not PDA type of gal when I first meet someone he came across desperate The drinks awesome crab enchiladas and unforgettable chocolate dessert were the highlight of the evening I enjoyed the conversations about his Polo days meeting the king and all the traveling adventures but he talked and talked and talked and didn t ask me anything Uh typical I guess he thought he had me figured out He even had a nice convertible Mercedes but the rambling ruined it Gotta love the invites to Cabo England and the like He doesn t even know me What is it with guys who meet you like the first impression and then want to plan trips with you I barely even go on trips with my best friends I don t get it Too bad I m not into him not sure how I m going to blow this off without feeling really guilty Oh well right another experience in the book and another insight into men how dating works and on what I m not attracted to During dinner the guy from the previous night called twice I m a little overwhelmed he s called four times today But for some reason I find it endearing that he wants to talk to me that much or maybe I should be worried that he doesn t have a life Like I said before I think I d rather just be friends with this guy then anything else I just am not attracted to these guys They re not ugly but not necessarily attractive either I m not a freaking Odonness but I think I need to raise my standards He s nice don t judge I think to myself but being attracted to someone is why I d want to be more than friends with them Anyway I m over it I actually like being along right now I have things to figure out things to overcome and things to accomplish before I m reading and willing to be 100 revealed which you need to be in a relationship Done venting now I m going to try and sleep wake up in six hours without a head ache and deal with the work drama Definitely glad I went don t need to go out with that one again While the English royal polo dreams are tickled I m not biting 

23	On Friday night I waited in a line wrapped around the block to see Fahrenheit 9 11 Holy cow what a rude awakening The movie obviously had a biased opinion but when supported with facts it is hard to not leave the theater completely appalled by the state of politics in America today You leave motivated to get involved unfortunately I feel a little discouraged because I don t like either of the presidential candidates But if you vote for an independent candidate then we re at risk for Bush winning again So we ll see who else if anyone pops up in the election but Bush needs to go that s for sure It has motivated me to think about getting involved in public office i e running for something one day but I m at loss to understand how that really works and what it involves Something to keep in mind I realized today just how hard it is to be a productive and top notch employee while doing excellent work and keeping managers happy I work for two different managers and on some occasions 3 and find that in busy times it s a little like playing pickle but hey the challenge is nice and will make me a better business woman so I can take over the WORLD HAHAHAHHA Just kidding Last night I broke my hiatus with dating I went out with a guy I met a Pearl a West Hollywood club who was a friend of a friend He was nice not as attractive as I remember must have been the two cosmos and the gin and tonic talking but very nice and quite the gentleman Not really a match a little like pairing Marry Poppins with Ozzie Osborn but a great funny guy who I d definitely like to kick it with no hidden meaning there Kinda weird I couldn t really get out of him what he does for a living i e how he supports himself which makes me a little worried but also a little curious I ll keep digging Tonight I m going out with some English man I met a week ago at Joya He s older 36 but is very charming and wants to I quote dote on me so why the hell not go out and have a good time This should be interesting he s picking me up at 7 and I have no idea what we re doing Hopefully he has a plan and doesn t show up saying so what do you want to do I like men who take charge except for in bed that s my job Hannah s home Ya it is so nice to see her and have her around and able to come out with all the girls Some drama but adjustments are underway It will take some time for everyone to find their fit Can t wait to have heated discussoins trip to get frozen yogurt and nights out on the town 

23	I just got back from my second Therapy appointment Already I m wondering if I need to be going every week I think once a month would probably do it The first session really really helped me and made me realize a lot of things that will help me understand relationships with different people in my life On a happier note today I found out who was recruiting for the Muppets on their marketing team I would LOVE to work on the Muppets marketing team a dream job So I wrote the recruiter and sent off my resume we ll see what happens but I m excited at just the possibility Keep your fingers crossed for me I don t even know if they have entry level marketing jobs right now but I ll take anything Funny bc just this morning I started feeling very anxious about my current career path and started to worry that I will forever not be satisfied if I stay where I am I want something I m excited about something that is fulfilling not just something I can do or that I m good at So tonight I have a date with Rich An old flame that I ran into at White Lotus last Wednesday I dated him for like 2 seconds two weeks or so I m pretty apathetic about it but he does have a BOOODY He was really sweet and very affectionate when we first started dating I ended after the two weeks bc 1 I was involved with Korey Mr Issues and 2 he made weird faces when we were making whoopie Weird I know probably just an excuse to end it but anyway Rich and I haven t talked since September or so We ll see how it goes and no I won t be getting or giving any tonight This weekend is up in the air Not sure what is going on a lot a little it all depends For some reason I m feeling very apathetic towards the whole thing Very unlike me After work yesterday a coworker and I went on a hike in Runyun canyon here in Hollywood It was nice she is a lot more out of shape than I am so it wasn t too much of a workout for me but it was good to have her company If I did that a couple of times a week and ran part of it damn would I be in good shape For now I am happy that I ve been exercising more and trying to eat better Right now though I just want sweets After work today we re going to El Torito for a friend s birthday so I m trying to not snack uh it s hard Chewing on gum right now hoping it will keep me for the next two hours I m really into tea lately Not just any tea but any teas that are suppose to promote health and well being I know don t all teas Nope I love Jasmine Green Tea Jasmine White Tea and Oolong tea Any tea with a ton of anti oxidants is good for me Ya know the whole anti aging thing comes into effect I m so paranoid of getting wrinkly I m not blessed with skin that doesn t wrinkle so I m trying to keep out of the sun take multi vitamins and use good face crèmes to help avoid pre mature aging So far so good but all the crap I eat isn t helping Oh well I think the biggest component to premature aging is sun damage That I can control Lately I ve been really thinking about how great it would be to live in the middle of Wyoming or Montana Just helping on a ranch riding horses hanging out with people from all different walks of life Doesn t that sound fabulous I hope someday I find someone to do that with It d be great to work on a ranch or at a bed and breakfast I d love to be an entrepreneur too but don t know what to do or how to Keeping this in mind though someday 

23	What a busy day yesterday and a long night At lunch I went and picked up my new glasses They re cute but liked my other ones better I always do though like the old pair better than the new pair Then worked until 6ish ran to the apartment to pick up a check ran to Target ran home ate dinner changed and shaved headed off to White Lotus with friends It was the ESPY awards last night so Hollywood was crackin but the White Lotus crowd wasn t that great It was actually really ghetto but they played good music A 1 and Eric Cubichi sp were there djs I could care less but my friend dated one of them once or something so she was all worked up about it Had a good time but am paying for it today seeing that I am sick I got a sore throat on Monday and since it s progressed to a little bit of the sniffles with just a touch of a cough Nothing bad thank god since I m heading to Palm Springs this weekend Michelle and I are getting manicures at the spa and plan to hit the town one night of our two Just a lot of relaxing shopping eating out and pampering ourselves I need to check on the money situation I feel like I ve been spending a lot lately I did just get paid finally by B D for my articles so that helps a lot But all of it is going towards the credit card so that sucks a big fat one Only 20 more minutes and then I m home for the weekend Yes I plan on catching a few hours of sleep that I didn t get last night watching Oprah and then I m suppose to call Ray to hang out I m so indifferent about this guy but he is so nice and considerate Talk about persistent he calls like every day practically Last night I felt bad though bc he and his boy came to the club around 1 to see me but I didn t have my phone on me so I had no idea they were outside By the time I called him back he was already home and was kind of pissed of course but got over it quickly He then called about 10 minutes later to make sure I got home okay and safely Nice of him We ll see but for now just friends and he respects that which is rare to find in men I m feeling good and a little more content with life Kinda seems like a period of transition or settling in but all will settle the way it s suppose to so I m not going to worry about it 

23	By the way Kim so glad to hear that you are skinnier than ever and looking mighty fine Damn I wish had one of those weekends of ultra sexiness soon hopefully Congrats on being one hot babe 

23	My timing seems to be off with everything lately From jobs to boys to clubs something s not in line Maybe it s the new space probe they sent to Saturn it s disrupting Saturn s rings and therefore throwing my life out of whack Just leave the solar system alone already although I m the first to be on NASA s web site to see what new pics the probe is sending back Anywho I found out that the recruiter for the Muppets marketing job is just about to fill the position Damn it If he would of written me back when he first got my e mail then I could of been considered But no he assumed from my current title that I was a finance geek and wouldn t want to apply to a marketing job So missed that one He said he let me know if anything else came up so I guess that s good that he has my resume and knows I m interested On Friday I had lunch with a guy who s place I took at Allergan He now works for NBC Universal in their home video marketing department He was really cool and very insightful Still not sure if brand management is the place for me Not enough analytics and numbers involved and seems to be more operations and production type stuff And in order to shift into that career path I d have to start at the bottom doing brainless work Not that I m not far from the bottom now but I feel like I m gaining some momentum If I get the promotion in September then I ll stay for another six months or so before I start looking for something that is more fitting I really am interested in Business Development or in Market research both of which we have here at Disney Career still TBD Like Hannah said It s not like you have a bad deal now Very true and sometimes I need to be more appreciative of my situation bc it s a pretty good deal for now Also on Friday I went to The Apprentice open call at Universal City Walk Once again my timing was off After working in the morning then lunch with the NBC guy I went home changed and headed off to the interviews They were suppose to be there until 4 30 but after valeting my car and rushing over to the scene everyone was gone The Universal info booth lady told me that they left early at around 12 30 bc they didn t get the turn out the wanted Great my ass changed into a suit redid my makeup printed out resumes on nice paper rushed over to Universal City paid to valet my car and all for nothing They are having open casting calls all over the US so maybe I make the trek out to Vegas to go to the tryouts an excuse to go to Vegas for the weekend Michelle s never been so maybe we ll make a trip out of it On Saturday morning I went on a hike felt very good then went to the mall and met Hannah and Lily for dinner at 5 30 or so After they both wanted to go home Hannah s ear is bothering her and Lily said she wanted to sleep and do nothing remember this for later So I went home Rich wanted to hang out but he was at a wedding He said he could leave the reception at anytime so I met him there When I talked to him he said he had eaten so that when I got there I d come in for a minute and then we d leave I got there he hadn t eaten well he ate an appetizer so basically he just wanted me to come and be on his arm I was wearing jeans for Christ s sake at a wedding I didn t think we were staying Anywho it was a Nigerian wedding at that so I was one of two non Nigerians in the room So my inappropriate attire was definitely noticed since I was definitely noticed Oh well After two gin and tonics I felt better got over it I was pissed at him though bc he lied to me about eating and he lied that he d come with me out afterwards to meet my friends So I m over him now I have to tell him again that it s not going to work out This time it wasn t timing that was off it s him Yes I understand that this is the longest blog ever but my boss isn t here today and I have nothing really to do so deal with my blabbering Ha just kidding So I went to meet friends out at Saddleranch There are two in Hollywood One at Universal City Walk and one on Sunset I thought they were at the Sunset one so I valeted my car and went in After talking with Claudia playing the where are you game on our cell phones I realized that she was at the Universal City Walk one Great just freakin fabulous So I paid for valeting my car for all of 10 minutes and went to U City Walk The valet there comped my ticket after a little convincing on my part thank god and I met them inside It sucked typical Saddleranch Cheesy music and way over crowded Then while walking through the crowd who do I run into Lily Yup she was out and about with Carey Loreg and friends The look on her face was priceless totally shocked and slightly worried I said What happened to sleeping She said Well I did and then Carey called me asking what I we were doing so ya come see us we re over there I nodded and walked away with Claudia At this point we were about to leave and head to White Lotus bc this place sucked I wasn t really pissed but annoyed If she doesn t want to hang out that s fine but don t lie to me about going out Lame o So I went over to say Hi really to see who was there and after I told her that I just hung out with Rich for an hour she said Ya that s why I didn t call you I thought you were hanging out with Rich Right excuses Just like she always makes up when she s late So I m over it I still care for Lily but she needs to stop lying to me and get over the fact that I don t care if she doesn t want to hang out that s fine let s be cool about it It irritates me that I think she doesn t want to hang out bc I don t just go along with what she wants to do I care if she s late I want to go to clubs and dance all night and I don t want to stand in the corner watching Just two different ways of enjoying nightlife Not sure how to address it or not address it But I hope she doesn t think I m stupid enough to believe all the excuses I get it you don t want to hang out Sunday was fabulous I visited my friend Nichole who just had a baby and ah how adorable is she I fell in love with her and realized at that moment that someday I will have kids Not now and when I meet the right bloke and have the right financial situation then I ll be ready She s fabulous Her name is Stella and holding her was such a dream I felt so bad and evil though bc she is so pure and so innocent Here I am still kinda pure but not really holding this little baby girl that has been nothing by an angel since she s been here Ah how refreshing and truly remarkable I just want to hold her all day This is not even my baby I can t imagine the love and protection you have for your own child Now I get motherhood just a little bit more THANKS MOM Last night I made a list A list of all the things I want to be and all the things I am now As of now I have half of the list completed and the things I want that I don t have characteristics that is are attainable So I m working on myself I working on myself so that I can become the person I want to be The timing issues with boys well what I blame on timing isn t really timing it is that I just am not ready and happy enough with myself to open up and connect with a guy in a romantic and intimate way No one right now will be let in I ve closed the gates and have put up a sign Under Construction I m excited about it and know that the only way I ll be happy throughout life and get what I want the life I want that is that I ll have to love who I am and what I represent Then all else will fall into place and I won t feel like the life I want I can t have it will come Lots of ups and downs this weekend but overall I think I ended up in a good place I must remain focused and consistent in my thoughts and behaviors and then before long my satisfaction with myself should

23	As most of you know my biggest ambition in life is to be happy Part of that is be happy with your career a big part of that since most individuals spend 40 hours a week at the office In an effort to make sure I will eventually be satisfied by my job I ve been informally interviewing professionals in different careers About a month ago I interviewed two people who work in PR for a firm called RLM pr I wasn t sure if PR was THE job for me after our conversations but I definitely thought it was a better fit than what I have now although these last few weeks haven t been bad Long story short I got an e mail on Wednesday from one of the ladies I interviewed about a job opening She wanted me to come in and interview with her bc they re interested in hiring me for the position It s in healthcare I d be working on the Allergan account I worked for Allergan for about a year in college and have total responsibility over the consumer health care market Meaning I d be pitching to consumer publications while my coworker and manager would be pitching to the trade industry The interview went very well I still don t know how much it would pay but I have until Tuesday to let them know if I m interested This is soooo complicated I still need to talk with my old manager at work to see if that promotion is waiting for me or if it is just a chance I d get it not set in stone that it d be mine I also have to find out what I d get paid at this new place bc eventually I d have to move to West LA or Santa Monica area they re off Wilshire west of the 405 Then I have to do some sole searching to see if this is the right opportunity for me It s a good opportunity but is it the right one Sometimes not every opportunity is a good one or the best one Who knows but for now I have to do some more digging within myself and within the opportunities in PR to see if I m interested Good news is that I d get to go on business trips The first in October to New Orleans the second to one in Hawaii another in DC and another in Florida Since we have our main office in NY I d get to go there often as well Who knows they want someone who wants to stay a while and who wants to grow within the company I guess by Tuesday I better have my mind made up if I m even interested great 

23	Now for the weekend update On Wednesday Kim and George stayed over before they headed to Austrailia for a sixteen day trip How fabulous It was really good to see them They such great people and so full of life They are the real thing no hidden agendas or feelings of having to put on a front I m jealous that they are off to an exotic location but more so that they have one another to travel with My best traveling buddy is hannah but no offense to her I don t want to jump in bed with her and be all romantic A definite qualification for my next honey is that he likes to travel One of my manager s at work is driving me crazy still I just am not going to get used to him He drives me nuts Whatever hopefully soon I won t have to work with him He s not bad but he just pushed my button s in all the wrong ways I m just going to have to suck it up and play nice Boo Friday was uneventful see previous blog posted for the evenings events Didn t go out Thursday however Hannah Shavonne and I went out to a club called Que s in Pasadena Lame The music was good but once again the people crowd wasn t good at all There really is no place like LA to find the oh so entertaining poser crowd at most night clubs Hannah and I had lunch on Friday afternoon which was nice I was on my way back from seeing a house my friend and I might buy which I m not going to but she is so I stopped in Chatsworth We always have good conversations always enjoyable Saturday I went on a hike in the morning and then took a nap and got ready to head to the OC We went to Michell s friend Brie s birhtday party It was nice She had sandwiches waiting and lots of alcohol Drank a lot We then headed to a new OC club called Vegas It was cool but the crowd wasn t too great and the music went from trance to techno to hip hop they needed to pick one genre and stick to it Headed home that night short one girl Michelle she was getting reacquainted with an old friend Wink wink Heeey Today was good Had really strange dreams last night none of which I can remember slept in until noon and then paid bills painted my nails talked on the phone read napped and then off to a movie and dinner with Michelle We saw Napoleon Dynamite It was sooooo good Absolutely hilarious I haven t laughed that hard during a movie in a really long time I recommend everyone to go see it and to stay after the credits bc there s an extra scene after Uh totally worth the eight dollars and very entertaining When I got home I had dessert of course remember who you re dealing with here and got ready for the week At some point on Sunday I always vacuum tidy up and prepare salads for the week ahead I used to cook meat too but not today I ll have to do that tomorrow I m looking forward to the following weeks There are things to do everyweekend until the end of August I can t believe it is almost August Time flies more reason to not put things off bc before you know it youth will be gone ah can t think about that how depressing I was telling Hannah how I feel like I ve experienced LA If I had to leave tomorrow I really feel like I got a good sense of all it has to offer I still have quite a few places to go but I have been many many places those well known and those not so well known Now I will work on myself and work on my life Thank god for the opportunity to live here though and experience this world reknowned place ther really is not where on earth like it LA is for sure a little ridiculous sometimes and the fast pace is enough to drive you crazy not to mention how expensive it is but it s fun it s exciting and most of all anything you want is available everynight and just a stone s throw away Gotta love that Those are my thoughts tonight before I turn in I m going to read a little more of a book I picked up on Super Foods Rx I think I naturally have a healthy palate now if I could just stop eating sweats and snack foods I d be home free Goodnight Quote of the day from a book called Why Men Love Bitches don t ask Before sex a man isn t thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly After sex in reverse The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn t Oh so true You gotta love that men just pour their hearts out after sex while you lay there in a daze hopefully if he did a good job 

23	Friday night was uneventful when I have too much time on my hands and I start sitting around thinking things can get scary This is a list of things I just came up with unedited while sitting in bed A look into who I am and what I beleive Kinda scary to share with everyone bc this is me in a nutshell but since I m moving into this new era of being confident with who I am I should be confident in what I think too and I am So enjoy maybe learn something new about this nutty one maybe not I believe that being kind and considerate to every person on earth is important I believe taking care of the earth and of ALL of it s creatures is important I believe that people are what makes life worth while not things I believe that true happiness comes from being content with who you represent and how you effect the rest of the world I believe that eating is a good thing and that an appetite is healthy I believe that dancing is a way to express yourself and a way to interact with strangers safely and intimately I believe that I am smart special and interesting I believe in a higher power and in guardian angels I believe that our family on the otherside looks down on us and watches over us I believe that with each year that passes I become infinitely wiser and that I can t wait to be older so that I can understand that much more who I am and what life is about I believe that fear will limit what great things each person could be I believe in unconditional love I believe in a woman s right to choose I believe that men are hot when they take care of themselves and are physically active I believe women are beautiful and unbelievealby complex creatures of which all mankind is depent on I believe in equal rights for all race religion sexual orientation age disabilities and appearance I believe that people are born good and that life and the challenges it presents can take a pure soul and turn it rancid Love heals all wounds and protects our spirits from distruction I believe in a challenge and in competition I support the arts I support the exploration of space and of our world I support those fighting to erase discrimination of every type I support those I love I support myself almost I support a good education for everyone I believe in luck and being in the right place at the right time I believe in listening to your soul and heart bc they know the right decision I believe that getting There will happen for me bc I work at figuring out where there is every day I believe that money is not satisfying I believe that a life of luxury is enjoyable and desirable I believe that without love and people life isn t worth living I believe that love makes everything okay I believe in exploration of all kinds Now wasn t that fun NOt Anyway I encourage everyone to do this Just to sit down and start typing You ll be suprised at what pops up on the screen Just think of everything you are sure of everything you believe to be true Maybe it will challenge you to think about what you believe maybe not maybe it will increase your confidence in what you believe This was interesting hope you found it to be as well 

23	It s been a good Sunday Enlightening productive and relaxing Last night was cool I went to a friend s surprise party where I didn t know anyone but the guest of honor and his girlfriend Kinda weird being there and not knowing anyone but I sucked it up and was social bc I wanted to be there for the one friend I knew They had some really nice friends there and some very interesting ones This one guy had rented a car one summer and drove from LA to the Arctic circle Yup just for kicks Just to go and experience it I was impressed the guy follows his dreams and ambitions even if they sound nuts I have so many thoughts and dreams but don t allow them to materialize I ve been watching two PBS shows this afternoon which is why I m in this mood of finding purpose I guess The one thing that I ve really taken from the shows is the fact that all the energies around you really do affect how you act feel and succeed in life If the energy around you is negative you tend to go with the flow and get sucked into the negative energy I ve know for a while know that LA isn t a healthy place to live and that someday I ll have to move on and live in an environment that is more conducive to a life where people respect the environment connect with eachother on a spiritual level and know that there is a whole lot more that money and fame to life It is so easy to get sucked into the trap of wanting the best car highest paying job newest cloths but really all of it doesn t matter and in the end that isn t what brings you happiness I m sure I m preaching to the choir a little bit here but just thinking out load On a funnier note I swore that with one big gust of wind or a minor earthquake this whole apartment complex is going to crumble to the ground It is constantly shaking what feels like mini earthquakes all the time When I first moved here I would freak out and practically duck and cover every time there was a little shake I still don t know what it is from maybe I have some obese neighbor or something that shakes the whole building I keep thinking that under the near by mountains there s a freakin volcano ready to erupt Totally not going to happen I know but damn this place better be retro fitted Heard a good quote today so thought I d share it It s a little scary and place a big personal responsibility on each of us make sure we take care of business Hope it hits home for you like it did for me Don t die with the your music still inside you Get out there and shine Whoever you are be that person Whatever you want to do do it Easier said than done trust me I m no example but someone do it so we can all get inspired already 

23	What a week what a weekend Bad good boring and invigorating this last week has encompassed it all Just to give you a visual I m sitting in the passenger seat of my car door open legs hanging out with my laptop on my lap ahh how appropriate in a parking garage in San Diego Random not really I m meeting Kim and a few of her friends at the Civic Center in SD to see the play Thoroughly Modern Mille for a belated birthday for Kim she s been vacationing in Australia for the last two weeks I can t wait to see her and hear about the trip I m living vicariously through her and to see the play I ve heard it s so good So I m facing out of my car and I can see a whole bunch of SD buildings and churches etc and the security guard of the pking garage came over to inquire what I was doing just incase I m planning on blowing something up Right I guess I kinda look suspicious but once he saw me and chatted with me I think he knew I was just some weirdo that paid to park in a parking garage and type on her laptop while slouching in her car Anyway back to my week recap of the bad good boring and invigorating The Bad On Tuesday I talked with direct manager about my issues with my project manager I had been told that some e mail was send around by my PMgr that I was missing deadlines I have never missed a deadline since I ve been at Disney and so understandably I was pissed So I told my DMgr my feelings on the issue how I ve never been given a project timeline or due dates for half of the things I was working on and so therefore I wasn t aware of my PMgr expectations In the end she understood agreed with me told me I need to manage up bc he is incapable of being organized etc She then pulled him in her office to again ask for proof that I was not meeting deadlines she had asked for it twice before and he never gave it to her He then was even more pissed at me for going outside him to tell someone else that he is difficult to work with In the end we ended up discussing more like arguing from 4 to 8 pm Ah it was aweful I loath him He is one of those Nothings ever my fault I use people as scapegoats Well he picked the wrong one bc I will not stand for it and will not take it I am not a yes man that s for sure We ll see how the next week or so goes but in Sept I ll find out about the promotion and if I don t get one then I m out of there bc I can t work with him The Good I chatted with Belle on the phone and I m so happy for her She has found the One scary I know She is so happy with Mateo they plan to get married within the next year or two and are moving in together next year He is a great guy she only deserves the best really she does so ya for her I m glad life decided to be nice I got to hang out with Jules this weekend too I worked the Princess Diaries 2 premiere at Disneyland and gave Jules the heads up to come out and see some of the stars So while I was helping some attendees find their seats and then later dressing their kids up in wedding gowns don t ask Jules was hanging out in Calif Adventure star watching The theater I was ushering was the best bc it had all the stars Lets see who was there Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown Holly Robinson Pete Raven a whole bunch of actors in the movie that I don t know the names of the mom from Greek Wedding Gary Marshall Anne Hathaway and to top it all off Julie Andrews While it was cool to see and talk to some of these people it was very anticlimactic I thought I d at least be excited or nervous and actually I didn t care one bit I think it reaffirmed the fact that I am done with the whole LA southern Cali thing It has been a blast and quite a way to spend my college years as well as the first two years out of school but I want to move to a more beautiful place with lots of trees rivers mountains and a quieter softer side of life The boring I ve driven all over Southern Cali this weekend From LA to San Diego and back All worth it of course but my ass hurts already The invigorating On Friday I went sailing with JP my hold boss and Tom her husband They belong to some yacht club in Newport and just bought a sail boat and on Thursdays and Fridays they race in the harbor against other boats It was soooooo much fun I never knew how hard it was and how much skill it takes to know how to maneuver a sail boat It was exhilarating Now of course I m pissed that while at UCI I didn t join the sailing team They were recruiting like mad when I was a sophomore through my senior year So I ve found something else that I like to do something I want to become a hobby and hopefully I can find a team that needs an extra crew member Anyway we got second place and a etched mug to keep and dinner Lots of fun but we were the youngest people there by about 20 years At a work offsite on Wednesday they hired a Tarot card reader to read everyones fortunes I was one of the last people to go but it was worth the wait She said that in a past life I was a spiritual master that I m on the same path as her great I ll be an overweight crazy tarot card reader and that I won t marry young but I ll marry right Ah lots of fun stuff to know but damn I wish I knew the specificis What the hell is a spiritual master as you can tell I think I left that side of me on the other side bc I m clueless when it comes to my spirituality and what is young Does she mean around 30 I ll run into Mr Right or does she mean like 50 I guess we ll just have to wait and see She also said that I always have the philosophical side of me and the rational analytical side of me pulling at one another To get satisfaction with life she said that I need to keep both in balance and never let one take over the other She is sooooo right I call it the logical vs dreamer side of me but it s true I go from wanting to live a life full of passion vs living a life full of responsibility and corporate success Gosh when I write it down it seems obvious to choose the life of passion but when you re broke life isn t fun either We ll see What a week This next weekend will be that much more interesting bc I m up North to go to my HS 5 year reunion I just love how I ve put on another 5 pounds since we chose a date shouldn t I be dieting You d think hu It s 12 28 time to go meet Kim and gang in front of the theater Peace and Love 

17	You ever notice that you feel great when you are compared to someone or something else and you come out on top I really noticed that again today I felt great when I someone told me that on of the other new hires that I work with was having a harder time with the work I should have felt bad because he isn t totally used to the work yet but no I had to feel good because I was more or less being told that I was better How very juvenile of me But there are little things that can make your day such as being honked at over twenty times while walking up and down a trucker route Don t ask me why but you still have to feel good when someone admires something you are or something you can do We all like praise but is there a point when it becomes like an obsession I think there is like when you almost rely on those kind of comments from someone just to feel like you are wanted or needed As people we need to feel like we are something that has a purpose and that we are admirable It is something that we all crave if you get it from doing charity work that is great for you If you get it from receiving awards that is good for you too If you get it from guys who check you out then you may need to assess how low your self worth is We will only tolerate abuse in any form to the level that we abuse ourselves We will stop taking the abuse when it hits that point And if our self worth is that low then we will take everybody s personal opinions so personally that we will become dependent on the compliments of others We need to realize that we all have different strengths and abilities and that there is more to us than what meets the eye If we need to have other look bad in order to make us look good then we have to stop and think When we are no longer able to make ourselves happy there is a problem When we become dependent there is a problem When we are only happy when someone else is miserable there is a problem If you have no self worth there is a problem I m not saying if you ever feel happy because in someone s eyes you are better than someone else you should go see a shrink But I m what I m trying to say is we should remember that even if no one says it we are something phenomenal and even if people disapprove if there is something that truly makes you happy you should do it for yourself Yes there are other people in your life that probably matter a lot but what is the point in living if you aren t able to enjoy yourself I want to enjoy my self so I try to do whatever makes me happy just so that I don t forget how important it is to enjoy the moment and not live waiting for the future You have to see what you have and not what you don t who should be able to decide what is beautiful and what is not Everything is beautiful in its on way Who is to judge what is right and what is wrong If your intentions are good that is all that matters This probably made no sense I m just going to stop babbling This went from organized thought to the way people talk in coffee shops 

17	I seem to be listening to music that causes me to go nowhere but further into my own world Every single one of the CD s that I have bought in the last three months are rather depressing All I can think about is how I haven t even talked to two of my friends since Saturday granted I don t talk to one too often But the other one I was talking to twice a day for the last couple of weeks So as you could probably tell I feel low like almost as low as I did last summer when I spent all of my time in my basement reading and seldomly talking to anyone I just want to get out of this rut but there is nothing that I can feel like I can do about it I try to be social and all I can do is really sit there while I am being hit on by guys at work for that matter they don t even look that bad buy I m not even really responding to it My goal this summer was to have fun and powder the shell that I have been working on breaking out of for the last nine years I feel as though I am invisible and none of my friends would even notice if I didn t talk to them in two weeks I may seem like the type at this point anyway that would commit suicide but hear me out I think I would never do it because it just isn t worth it It seems pointless at times but in the past it has always gotten better and plus then you are just caving in you are taking the easy way out I am a person who doesn t like to show when they are weak This is one of those times I need to get out of this rut for my own sake not for anyone else but myself I would like the guy who I like to not be so blind and notice me what he says about why he likes my friend is exactly what we have In theory we would be great together in theory My music is all poor me as my friend would say I need something that will just mellow me out without making me obsessed with the negativity that is my mind Actually the thing that would ultimately help would be to find an activity that I don t think while doing Most people would say it is impossible but I think I may think too much All I seem to do is go through all the what if s in my mind I need to get out of the madness that is my mind and my alternate reality and get back to the real world 

17	Why is it that whenever there is something or someone we want we just can t have them Is it that they do not desire us or that it just isn t possible for us to have everything that we want Lets face it when a celebrity says Money doesn t buy you happiness we reply with Bull shit But even if you have all the tools at your disposal sometimes we just can t get what we want when there is nothing stopping us in theory For instance an apartment that you totally were meant to have you met all of the requirements you can actually afford the rent and it has a kick ass location and yet someone else got that apartment And then there are jobs you go into the waiting area early a lot of the people arrive after you you have experience that exceeds their expectations and you look awesome in the dress code without so much as being next to the line of non acceptance but someone else who in your opinion less qualified then you got the job And last but not least there are guys You have similar interests you look good together and there are no awkward pauses even when you first meet them but there will always be someone else that they have their eyes on This someone else may be a friend or better yet your best friend or someone who has nothing in common with the person or who doesn t even have the same feelings toward the person when you are right there How crappy does life have to treat us There is always something missing it is near impossible to be truly satisfied with your life for even a second I mean I listen to the guy even give him pointer on how to get the courage to ask someone out who isn t even interested in him sure I could like say I think I really like you or something along those lines but no I have to be the friend The worst part is that I am the friend for both sides I feel like I should help the guy out to get what he really wants like I know his intentions are good but that isn t what is meant to be And for the non interested friend I have to feel more obligated to helping them out more simply because I have known her longer and she wants me to have to break it to the guy that she really isn t interested Wouldn t be so hard IF I DIDN T LIKE THE DAMN GUY I don t like his friends I don t even like some of the things he likes but it is like I feel a connection with him when I try to help him he makes me want to be a good person and do the right thing I am happy to try and help him gain confidence mean while I can t even do the things that I am telling him he should do such as just tell her to her face that he really likes her Last night I even had the perfect opportunity to tell him how I felt but I just couldn t do it I told him that I normally have a hard time opening up to people I don t know that well and he asked why I could do that with him my response was I really don t know I just can Sure it isn t as bad as it could have been but it was an opportunity that I shouldn t have turned down But it was my birthday and I still haven t confessed and told him that there isn t really a way that my friend would ever go out with him but I still missed an opportunity that will probably never happen again But that is that sad story of how my brain and my heart have conflicted within the last two weeks I think I got the most of that out of my system 

17	Whoa there are chicks on this ride Had to put that one in otherwise I would totally forget it I don t have too much to talk about other than the fact that I seem to be putting back on some of that weight that I lost so that sucks Ummm Yeah I really don t have anything to say so I m just gonna leave it at that 

17	I am so over Kevin But as for the Carmicheal situation this looks like it will become a force to be reckoned with 

17	I lost my phone today but I got it back I was sooooooo incredibly like frustrated and pissed and scared at the same time But this little kid found it outside of 711 so yeah after I called it and he answered it I arranged to meet him so that I could pick it up He was like 11 and his name was DJ So that explains the title of this thing I also got sunburned today I ve gotten burnt about 7 times this year I didn t have enough time before Gabe got here to put on sun block but the whole it was 40 degrees outside thing didn t help But it was fun after I got my cell back We walked around a bunch and I got a plain cheap tank so that I can go with Sean and Carmicheal to the water slides But I still don t know who all is going But I thought last night was fun with them so I agreed to go Hmm I can t really think of anything to talk about so this is all I m going to write 

17	So yeah I met Sean today as well as Carmicheal I don t know how to spell his name for the record We wandered around Vernon a bit I t was overall pretty enjoyable Carmicheal is pretty nice not overly punk or anything though his 3 piercings would possibly suggest otherwise friendly thinks a good bit actually and his looks aren t disappointing He does the whole physics math info tech thing So he seems like the kind of guy I may end up interested in I ve more or less only talked to him once but I have met him once before For like 1 minute Sean seems a bit friendlier during the summer and I am actually thinking about going to the water slides with them on Sunday For the record the title of this entry does have something to do with what happened today but not too much We went to Safeway and they stole two cans of pop well actually Sean did But it isn t a big deal It s just I couldn t think of anything better to title this entry So there you have it actually they left like 16 minutes ago So I really don t feel like I have that much to talk about I just felt like I should record this little bit so that it seems like I actually did something today aside from attempt a tattoo design yet again and sleep So yeah that is all I m gonna write because I have to meet Gabe tomorrow at noon 

17	I love days off actually I just like the idea of them I like to have things planned for my days off and normally I do more walking and work like activities on these days than when I am actually at work It is kind of funny Hmmm well I m trying to lay off on the spending of money but it isn t working too well I spent close to 100 dollars in a week So yeah I m trying to stop that My first step will be to not go into the mall during at least lunch For that matter not go into a place where I can easily spend the money in my bank account with my card This will be hard What kind of a place doesn t accept debit cards nowadays Well I will just have to control myself because at this rate I won t be able to afford it And plus I want to go shopping Like hard core before school It is like the thing I look foreword to in the summer But this isn t news to me but it does tend to shock people as soon as it turns August I start to become impatient waiting for my school schedule It might sound weird but like I do enjoy doing noting for a while but then I get depressed and really bored and sometimes I get fat so it isn t a good thing for me to do absolutely nothing during the summer Most people go out and do the whole beach thing but I really don t like the beach I don t really like the outdoors that much So as a direct result of that and the anti social factor that tends to happen to me through the summer I spend a lot of time in my basement I just like having decisions where I can alter them a bit to better suit me but they are still set enough that it isn t all up to me Example of set going to work it is scheduled and I can t really turn down the shifts because then I will lose my job Example of up to me decision deciding whether or not to go to college But I like things where I just go with it and that is what school is for me I get to alter my courses choose my friends and decide how I should dress But I more or less still have to go work is less lenient but it is still structured enough for me Like before I was all I m going to college but now I don t even know if I want to go Well I m tired now so that is all I m gonna write 

17	One day I m like I really like him the next after he is aware of the fact I m like I m so over him today I m like I don t know how I feel about him Do I believe his friend or do I believe my heart or should I believe my logic As you can tell I most likely just need a person undaunted by this situation to tell me what to do and how to feel There are times when I think he is lame there are times when I think he is my savior and there are times when I just want to be friends I AM SUCH A MESS RIGHT NOW This is so un me I am the girl that never had a little boyfriend in like grade two For that matter I am the person who has never had a boyfriend I m the person who didn t really have a crush or anything until like high school I m the person who doesn t believe in love I m the person who put Pawn an engagement ring bonus if its mine on my 50 things to do before I die list This isn t me I was logical I was sarcastic I was Sara Now I m this lame mess that doesn t get attention from any guys whether they like me or not Am I that undesirable Am I the person who is destined to die alone I give up on trying to figure this mess out 

17	Ok I admit I cheated But wouldn t you had the opportunity presented itself I got Jerry to tell Kev that I liked him Sure this way I have no real way of telling how he reacted to it but still I do feel somewhat relieved I don t really feel like talking right now so that is all I really have to say 

17	I feel like I have been uncovered from the dark depths of loneliness I have been talked to by people My one formerly depressed friend is more optimistic And I have been told that yes I should have a party I feel good today and that seems to be a rare thing in my world to be truly happy for even a moment I m currently doing the ever so harsh task of loading all of my CD s back onto my computer So far I only have like a third of them on here but it isn t that bad because if I had a music downloader for the last few months that I have been without one this task would be worse I m also not putting my crappy CD s on here again I m the kind of person who never throws out CD s but rather keeps them as a reminder of were I have come from so that I hopefully I only progress instead of regress Though I am listening to my somewhat depressing music I am not feeling depressed THIS IS GREAT Um I m feeling bubbly so I m going to pointlessly babble until I get tired of typing I was watching the A E thing on Blonde Bombshells sure I ve seen it like 3 times already but I m just fascinated by them The 3 that the thing is on are Jayne Mansfield Brigitte Bardot and of course Marilyn Monroe I think their appeal is that their confidence was amazing they weren t really concerned with their figures though the 50 s were the time for curvy women They had this insane control Bardot sure maybe she wasn t the most politically correct person but she did the whole save the animals thing as well as politics And Mansfield she worked so hard for what she loved sure she went downhill really fast near the end but you need to look at the good things about a personality right And Monroe she was someone who had this control it didn t really seem like she had that much but look at how many people were behind here at the height of her fame also self destructive near the end But there are qualities that you have to admire about a lot of people You just have to look past the traits that you think are undesirable They can be friends politicians musicians or even volunteers There is always something there and that is what I tend to search for in other people even if they may appear to be weird and I seem to think that there is something else going though their minds I will try to figure out what it is and if it is a trait that I admire 

17	Why is it that when ever I have good intentions people have to test me in one way or another Like testing my patience or tollerance Why can t they just do the damn thing like they do every other thing they do throughout the day But no they have to take a really long time and pushmy buttons Well there are virtues that I may possess but I don t believe that patience is one of them That is my rant I just wanted to get that out 

17	I have this thing about guys who work in grocery stores It is kind of odd It is like funny Ok it isn t that weird considering how many guys I know that work in a grocery store but still There was this one time and it was like the first and most memorable incident I was in Safeway and I was with my friend and her sister Her sister was going down to the states for a while so she was picking up things like toothpaste and a toothbrush I think that we had dropped off her artificial leg earlier that day so she was on crutches and as you may know it isn t pleasant standing in line while on crutches so I stood in line for her And we had been driving around for at least an hour because we went to Kelowna for the day So I was to say the least beat due to me being prone to motion sickness Any way I was in the express checkout lane when this guy working the cash register was apparently checking me out I didn t really notice at that moment or I would have responded better But from what I can remember he had sandy blonde hair he was tall kind of typical guy lanky and he may have had braces I think I had braces or I just got mine off recently at the time so it didn t really faze me But he was all How are you today My response was Fine but I mumbled it because I was drained And after that and I paid for the stuff he was all Have a great day Serious emphasis on the great And as soon as we got out of earshot my friend and her sister started laughing their asses off I couldn t figure out why They were all You were being checked out by the express checkout guy well it is kind or amusing when you think of it And it was really amusing though it may not sound like it you just had to be there But now I work in a grocery store I have two jobs in the one store so there is plenty of time to check out the half decent guys so yay for me But there is this one service clerk who went to my school but he graduated this year and I still have a year left Anyways I think he is to say the least hot I have the whole time I knew him So like 4 years But he had a girlfriend who I ve known since kindergarten but she cheated on him so he dumped her Any ways I do believe that he has been checking me out the whole time I ve been working there so like 3 months But the problem is that he doesn t talk to too many people like casually So as a result of my hypocritical ways of being to chicken to make the first move I think that if anything were ever to happen it would be a few months But I ll keep you guys informed And there are a few other guys but I m more interested in Josh at the moment Did I mention that I am almost over Kevin The key word being almost there is no telling if it will start up again But yeah I m tired and I have to work in like 8 1 2 hours So this is all I m going to write right now

34	high volume on ECGI again today 6 1M shares avg 3 9M up 9 Is this due to a pre earnings run up for the end of the quarter or is there M A news I m not sure but still holding my shares I have standing sell orders in at 1 and 1 25 The yahoo message board of course is going crazy with speculation I m glad it s the end of the 2nd quarter of the year for my e trade account I needed at least 27 trades to keep my power e trade status where I pay 10 trade I had 36 trades for the quarter and I m more than happy to have the count reset for a new quarter The thing is though with my stocks so far down I wonder if I ll really do any trading Maybe ECGI will run up faster than I expect though The only problem with selling is knowing what to do with the proceeds In this case though I should obviously pay down the HELOC debt Another alternative is to pay down the auto loan debt but I ll be paying 280 month for the next 4 years on a 4 9 loan That s not too bad comparable to my heloc rate Then again it s possible that by the end of this quarter i ll be out of the market altogether having sold off everything to settle with L

34	That s the word I was trying to think of Language is so cool isn t it I always wished I took an epistemology course in college Or something about the development of language Then again I probably would have had to read a lot and THINK and write papers I think about doing all that now and I think Ug I hate writing papers Introduction 3 main points discussion conclusion And that s the basic paper Then there s the more advanced papers that just go on and on Supporting evidence What is it called with the footnotes I ll probably remember the word in another post where you reference works in your bibliography APA style Ah I forget Too much LSD when I was younger I guess Now that was a good drug Hallucinations staying awake all night just visualizing cool things Fucking up my brain I guess But not addictive I remember going for walks in the neighborhood with friends while tripping So cool how the senses were so fucked up or highly attuned I never could be sure which I remember how different pockets of air smelled differently and had distinctly different temperatures Oh and did I mention the hallucinations I was so fucking shy back then so introverted I think I was probably trying to cope with all the changes going on in my life Between my parents divorce their re marriages moving around the country trying to make new friends I never was too good at that But no no heroin I d never try anythng addictive I liked oral drugs LSD on the tiny squares of paper Mushrooms once or twice Why can t I remember how many times Friends tried to get me to do marijuana first but I had no interest in the smoke Oral is so much easier I guess LSD is bit more powerful though The last trip I had though was bad real bad where I was alone and depressed and feeling suicidal That was back in college when I tripped with a guy I hardly knew I thought were going to vegetate in his apartment all night instead 30 minutes into our trip he said let s go to a party Just what I wanted to be around a bunch of strangers I probably would have felt even more alone there Or maybe my life would have changed dramatically in some distinct way Instead I walked back to my apartment Three other college people were walking across the library parking lot and made fun of me for being by myself Maybe they saw my dilated eyes Needless to say it didn t help my self esteem I went back to my aparment and sat in the dark listening to depeche mode s violator album Ah those were the days Back when I was still writing poetry Now I haven t written anything in nearly 5 years How can I still call myself a poet Will I ever hear the muse talking to me again Well that post went in a different direction than I expected

34	So the first date didn t go so well I waited at the restaurant for 20 25 minutes and she didn t show up Some people think I didn t wait long enough but how long am I supposed to wait Did she simply blow me off or was she just running late I ll never know I guess I left her a message at home and sent her an email no response Things seemed so good via email Maybe I shouldn t have talked religion on our first phone conversation After leaving the restaurant I had gone home and I guess L and the kids and just gotten home The kids were excited to see me but I was feeling very irritated I don t know why L was upset that I wasn t more patient with them I changed into shorts and went out not sure where to go but feeling in the pits I thought about going to the beach in Milford or calling a friend or just going for a bite to eat by myself but it all felt so depressing I was feeling a little suicidal I went to Dean s house and just dropped in I felt a little bad doing that but I was really down so I needed to see someone He did his best to make me feel better Then he said let s update your profile and update your pictures on the dating service So we did that he made it more fun I guess Eventually he got tired of living the life a single guy through me and he kicked me out I went home even though I should have probably wandered around or gone for a bite to eat or done something I don t know what I went home and L said oh good your home do you mind if I go out for a drink Whatever I just wanted to take an ambien and end the night I actually opened the bottle and fantasized about taking the whole bottle But I m responsible now and I shouldn t have such thoughts Sunday we had a late breakfast with L s folks at Cracker Barrel It was good I like that place even though it doesn t lend itself to helping me with my attempts and vegetarianism I had poached eggs fried catfish buttermilk biscuits with honey and ice water After breakfast I couldn t resist getting some chocolate covered malted milk balls Then L took the kids to the zoo and I presumably went to look at houses I drove by some but then got a little bummed out and drove home I played computer games until around 1 30 and then decided maybe I should do some yardwork Just as I was getting started L came home with the kids I mowed trimmed and dug up the weeds At one point I saw about a 5 foot long black snake on the rocks I showed it to L as it was slithering down the rocks to under the deck I was a little nervous but did a little more yardwork before taking a rest A real estate agent came at around 4 30 and meandered about in conversation eventually telling us our house could sell for 400k After commissions and closing costs I think we d each get about 45k in profit That s not as much as I thought we d get and L was a little dismayed by it too But on the other hand it would be that much cheaper to buy her out So now I feel like I m at a crossroads again Maybe I should keep the house I bought the 05 Matrix today So much paperwork It s fun to drive but looks a little different from what I remembered less sleek more boxey Oh well it s just a car The free cell phone I was supposed to get required paperwork and won t be me for a week and then I ll have to sign up for service I ve also been trying to get ahold of our mediator to figure out what paperwork i have ot send back but I haven t been able to get ahold of her I hope it s not too much of a problem I don t want to send the wrong thing Well that s enough rambling for now 

34	Thursday night L said that kids had just gone to bed and had been asking for me so I spent a little time with each before going to my room I had gotten a page from Jennifer at around 7pm She left me a voicemail at work saying sorry she missed me for my invite to a drink on Tuesday She said I could call her up until 10pm Dean had left a bunch of messages at home and at work so I called him back first He got the new job but something was amiss and he was feeling a little paranoid about the deal I told him not to worry about it what will be will be Email from jennifer asked what the visitation arrangement was with the kids I had said every other weekend which weekends did I have the kids I called her at home at 9 20 and got her voicemail Then I responded back in email that I was free Saturday and was it too late to ask her out for Saturday night She emailed me back in the morning saying it was not too late to ask So we re going to dinner at Citrus in Milford and then to fireworks in Branford I called her last night and we spoke for about 30 minutes ironing out the plans and getting to know each other a little If it works out and we get along and we have some attraction to each other then I have two of our next dates planned out already maybe Camping trip with co workers and friends weekend of 7 10 Then a minor league baseball game with my kids on 7 23 Maybe other dates in between I m probably getting ahead of myself I looked at her profile again and saw a few things that would normally turn me off occasionally smokes only a high school education We ll see I m excited the L had to cancel her plans for tonight because she couldn t find a sitter for the kids We re going to breakfast with her parents tomorrow I m doing laundry today and looking into putting our house on the market 

34	My trip to Philadelphia was good but short and filled with a lot of traffic It took us about 4 1 2 hours to get there mostly because we were sitting in traffic in New York around the GW bridge Then it took us 4 hours to drive back this time sitting in traffic around New Jersey Normally it should take about 3 hours each way I took Wednesday off instead of working a half day as I d originally planned It ended up that Mike took the whole week off so we could have left earlier in the morning instead of at closer to 2 He had also left me a message last Saturday to get directions to the hotel but I never got the message His computer was down and he didn t have a number for the hotel so we couldn t get directions So we drove back to my house to use my computer He drove I navigated When we walked I navigated He was sick but sometimes felt okay at least okay enough to eat steak and eggs on Thursday morning and okay enough to drink when we went to a club after the show Here s a rundown of our activities Arrive in Philadelphia check into the hotel Walk to the show stop for a quick bite at a sushi bar Get into the show my body was immediately immersed in and pounded by the bass by the band currently on stage Tweaker Mike looked at t shirts but decided not to get a shirt right away the lines were too short We walked in and took a spot near the stairs I saw people sitting on a radiator and joined them The radiator was uncomfortable but better than standing After Tweaker they piped solo stuff from Cevin Key with videos of nature on the screen Skinny Puppy eventually came on the first four songs were from their new album which I didn t really know or like Then they moved into songs from older albums which the crowd loved and I loved I already forget the playlist but it was very cool to hear them in concert Mike then stood in long lines for a t shirt meanwhile I talked to some vegans at a booth to find out more about the vegan lifestyle then we walked across the street to Shampoo for an after hours show It was extremely crowded and loud and it s not like you could have a conversation but there was great eye candy watching all the goth girls After one drink I was exhausted and we took a cab back to the hotel after an ambien I was asleep within 10 minutes The next day I woke early and journaled a little on scraps of paper Then I got bored and went for a walk When I got back Mike said he was feeling better We walked to breakfast where he got steak and eggs I never heard of anyone eating steak for breakfast I guess I ve lived a sheltered life I got a raspberry banana smoothie and french toast with banana compote it was great Then I waited outside while mike went to the bathroom then we walked toward historical philadelphia About halfway there Mike said let s turn back he was feeling sick So we turned back went back to the hotel he went to the bathroom again Then we got the car and started driving out of the city I said hey let s just stop at 526 S 5th Ave for the industrial music store I got a thing with remembering number I don t know way We got there a little before 12 and they weren t open yet So we went to a progressive independent bookstore I looked for a book on domestic terrorism but didn t find anything I liked then I found books on veganism and bought one recommended by the girl running the store Mike bought some progressive magazines At Digital Ferret I bought a CD with previously un released 16 volt stuff an Industrial Nation mag the new Chem Lab a DVD of Skinny Puppy videos and a cd with that mitsubishi commercial song days go by Then Mike was feeling better so we walked to see the liberty bell once there another trip to the bathroom for mike while I watched kids play soccer on the field outside Then we saw the liberty bell Pretty cool there was a whole exhibit outside but we didn t spend much time there because we were concerned about the parking meter running out of time and we wanted to get on the road relatively soon Then we went to City Tavern Est 1773 for lunch Great lunch nice atmosphere Shouldn t have ordered dessert while mike was in the bathroom again On the road Plotted an alternate route to the GW bridge via 287 Stuck in traffic in NJ That was basically it I would like to go back to visit again maybe for a weekend or something 

34	darkness hopelessness no future in sight a past to be forgotten a present I cannot escape curl into a ball never tight enough cannot merge with myself immense pain cry a bitter cry nothing is real everything is so distant cannot relate loneliness regret failure no way out trapped no solution but one anybody got a gun when s the next train wish I listened more carefully at the boy scouts so I could tie a noose don t take my picture you ll steal my soul If you can t laugh about death what can you laugh about suicide 

34	I think it s about time I do another mind map I do a mind map which shows me where I am in my life What is my foundation for life What are my relationships What are my short and long term goals What is the meaning of life at this moment How do I embrace life How do I embrace my life How do I embrace the future and the past How do I live in the present How do I be me Who am I Sometimes it s hard to fight the desire to commit suicide It s so inviting The end of everything Pain Grief Suffering Yeah and happiness and joy and all that bullshit too What keeps me going mostly is my kids That and I think that while things are dark and I m in the pit right now things will get better some day Maybe I m just deluding myself though I think a better alternative to suicide is drastic change Another alternative is a fantastic adventure Adventure is just one step away 

34	Think you re being a non conformist Think you re somehow unique and different from everyone else Good luck with all that It s an illusion There is no unique there is no different maybe just different combinations of choices in life that form the unique you If you strive to be different trust me you re still conforming in some ways Conforming to cultural and social standards You can t help but be a consumer in this culture Some companies specifically market to the counter culture such that the counter culture is a culture in itself For example tattoos body piercing body modification of any kind is an attempt to be different But really people see other people who have modified their bodies and they want to be like these other people Simply waving hello to someone or nodding your head or whatever these are culturally accepted standards of behavior Imagine instead when someone says hello to you that you respond with something random and unexpected People might think you re a little crazy But if you continue to respond to hello in this way you are now conforming to a new code of behavior What does it mean to live life fully To enjoy life To enjoy living Whenever I go to a restaurant and order food I am at odds with myself over different things like the cost of the meal what I want to eat I never really know what s good for me I m at such odds with myself that I change my mind frequently never really happy with what I ve chosen always thinking I should have gotten something else Will I like what I m getting Maybe it s good to eat something that I don t like just for the experience of it Like eating octopus tentacles for their chewy texture and odd feeling in the mouth Should I just get whatever I m familiar with What if this place doesn t prepare it the way I like it though I find that a lot with salmon restaurants frequently overcook it leaving it a little too tough Fish can be so delicate to cook Maybe I should eat vegetarian because what right do I have over the animals to eat them How barbaric Maybe I shouldn t use any animal products or any products that have been tested on animals because it s inhumane But do I really want to spend my life trying to keep in mind what s been tested on animals only consuming from certain companies that are conscious of animal rights Is that what my life is about How should I spend the time that I have on this earth I waste so much time So much Watching TV movies at night porn masturbating It s very enjoyable at the time but I don t really gain any value from it I play computer games that a big time sink I sit at work surfing the web blogging reading and writing email checking my stock quotes reading stock message boards Oh yeah and I work once in a while too I haven t really worked and I mean worked a 40 hour week in I don t know how long So what the fuck am I doing at work I m getting paid for sitting on my ass basically wasting my time and doing a couple of work related tasks just enough to get by Then again maybe my manager is out of touch with what s really going on It would be cool to be doing something self expressive something artistic with my life But then I might be stuck in a different rut stuck in the rut of having no money and not being able to afford decent housing for me and my kids Not being able to afford nice vacations Not being able to afford netflix and cable tv and a broadband connection to the net I need broadband so I can remote into work occasionally and do real work Mostly I need broadband for porn It s sad isn t it I guess I m addicted So many addictions so little time 

34	ECGI is up nicely today If my trade had gone through at 45 I would have likely sold some at around 55 Would have been a tidy little profit Instead I d pulled my money out to buy the car Oh well Oh yeah it s also up on high volume 10M shares traded today currently up 58 trading up 20 Up on high volume usually means good things I ve heard before that precedes price The big question is whether it closes near the high for the day and whether the volume continues at it s current rate If the price and volume drop off near the end of the day the tomorrow doesn t look as good In the meantime other stocks aren t moving much and RCO is down 02 Green day overall so far though 

34	It was a great trip on Saturday It was supposed to be a 25 mile bike ride but it turned out to be closer to 32 A lot of fun but at times I got fed up with the group and the close clustering of bikes happens frequently on group rides On the way back I got ahead of the group then waited at the top of a hill but they never came waited a good 5 minutes Then I thought maybe I d taken a wrong turn or they went a different route and should I go back and try to find them I was low on water and getting tired already so I figured I d just go on ahead The only problem was I wasn t exactly sure which way to go But I made it back alright I thought for sure the group would be there already eating lunch but I was waiting a good 5 10 minutes before they started to arrive Weather wise it was nearly perfect overcast in the morning but the fog burned off by late morning noontime We rode from Pat s condo through Milford Orange and to West Haven all along the shoreline mostly flat It was so relaxing She s got a condo right on the beach I ate lunch on the seawall looking out on the sound Her mom also brought out watermelon for everyone and tuna salad for sandwiches I couldn t get enough watermelon until I realized I ate too much Nonetheless we soon got underway for the kayak trip for the afternoon I was a little unsure of myself and how steady the kayak would be but soon enough I was comfortably paddling along I kept up with the group pretty well at first but soon grew tired At one point two people turned and went back they later reported that they saw the rest of us paddling but not going anywhere that must have been where we had a head wind and were going up current it was quite frustrating Kayaking around was a lot of fun but it was tiring and I fell behind the rest of the group I wanted to just sit out on the water and relax and watch birds but I felt I should try to catch up That afternoon L told me that Ivy was at her parent s house while Aidan stayed at home I got him up from his nap played with him outside walked down to the check the mail and then he an L had some dinner I cleaned up my office which was a pigsty so that it would be at least half presentable After dinner Aidan came into my office and we played together while L went down to her dungeon to do phone and email and match I re discovered an Opus III CD while Aidan zoomed a lego car around I would have loved to play with Aidan for longer but I had friends coming over for poker night so I got him ready for bed While I was reading him a story the first visitor arrived and L was uncormfortable enough where she finished with Aidan while I entertained my guest Poker was a lot of fun too guys from work and Dean played I was up for most of the night but then lost near the end as I started to get bleary eyed and had trouble concentrating or maybe I just started losing down 10 for the night Not bad for an evening of entertainment with friends Father s day was a bit of a letdown in comparison to Saturday I worked a little in the morning and then wasted time playing a computer game until L got home with Ivy and Aidan from breakfast with her folks at the diner L then wanted to clean up the house so I took the kids outside and played with them in the tent I also did a little weeding on the front walk We then went inside and I was feeling very irritable antsy So while L watched the kids I went out for an hour I was going to go to the grocery store to buy a few things and L gave me a list of things she wanted but instead I drove around Milford looking at potential houses L had dinner ready when I got home but was upset that I hadn t gone to the store I didn t give an explanation After dinner I played with the kids some more and L got ready for her date She left at some point I didn t hear her say she was going I put Aidan to bed first then I got Ivy ready and then we went outside to sleep in the tent I read her a few stories and tried to lay down in the tent buy my allergies were killing me So Ivy suggested we go back in I put her to bed and then played on the computer for a little while before watching six feet under 

34	Did anyone else get this I got an invitation in the mail to go to Washington DC to have dinner with the president Sponsored by the republican party I m not a republican so I don t know why I got this piece of mail Oh and if I want to go to the dinner I just have to make a donation of 150 or more That food must be really good I wonder if they ll foot the bill for the airfare I m thinking of buying Robert Reich s new book urlLink Reason Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America to get better educated about how the republicans are duping the American voters The majority of American s are non voters who generally have liberal values belief in separation of church and state that taxation and wealth should be more equally distributed and everyone should have fair access and fair opportunity It s funny whenever I talk to Christians they believe that the majority of Americans believe in a Christian God they may even believe that this majority includes practicing Christians people who attend church on a regular basis Personally I think most American celebrate Jewish or Christian holidays because that s how they were raised and they consider themselves Christian or Catholic or Jewish but they don t truly believe or they don t truly practice It s scary to me that Bush says he talks to God and gets direction from God First off that s a little crazy maybe it appeals to some fanatical religious people But mostly it s a bit scary that he feels he s doing what morally right and what God wants him to do He also talks about the military like it s his own personal army I m going to send more troops to Iraq I m going to send more troops to Afghanistan Even the Pope is against the war but Bush seems to ignore that The Pope s view doesn t gibe with Bush s so Bush ignores the Pope Not that I put a lot of value in the pope It s scary that we pre emptively attacked Iraq and that some democrats approved giving Bush the power to declare war Why is congress giving up it s powers If Bush is president for another 4 years the American life as we know it will completely cease to exist it s already on the way out with things like the PATRIOT act Speaking of the PATRIOT act I think it s quite clever maybe conniving is a better word for them to create an acronym spelling PATRIOT when the act really has nothing to do with patriotism It s really about giving up individual freedoms and more government control And it s scary that Bush has pushed for massive tax cuts for the rich while pushing more responsibilities onto the states Now the states can t handle the new financial responsibilities and they have to make cuts in other programs number of teachers teacher pay school programs state government workers countless other things that I m not aware of I don t know if Kerry will be any better But I m definitely in the anybody but bush camp Personally I like Kucinich who opposed the war with Iraq and I d consider voting for an independent if I thought they realistically had a chance to win in this two party system either someone from the Green party or the Libertarian party

34	So I didn t realize all the stuff that goes into buying a car The car guy called me up and asked when I could take delivery I thought cool they re going to deliver it to my house now that s convenient That makes the destination charge make sense But no I go to the dealership to pick it up It s supposed to be there tonight but I got Yoga tonight watching the kids tomorrow night saturday is the hiking kayak trip sunday they re closed So it look like monday Which is fine But in order to do the down payment they can t take a personal check they need a bank check So I deposited funds from my brokerage account and the bank said the funds would be available after 3 business days Tuesday Well that doesn t work so well Then Wednesday and Thursday next week I ll be in Philadelphia So what Tuesday I don t know if Tuesday works for me I could put the down payment on the credit card up to 3k they said Maybe I ll do that and transfer the brokerage funds somewhere else I also had to call the insurance company and get the new vehicle on my insurance Plus the dealership does credit check on me to determine what percentage I can get on the loan probably 4 5 If I d moved faster and bought in April they still had the 1 9 deals going but then no 05 Whaddayagonna do I also talked to E trade yesterday to extend my HELOC I ll close on that in about two weeks they bumped my limit up to 100k Crazy numbers really But I can use that credit line to help pay off L s portion of our marital assets I just imagine the house will be a great investment that will really pay off in 5 years Much better than I could do in the stock market Last night s hike was good It was just me and another guy Darren We talked a lot about relationships work camping hiking and religion It was exhausting and my left boot was causing me a blister again Maybe I ll buy new boots I ve thought that before the divorce is finalized I should spend money needed to fix up aspects of the house that s fair right Fix the garage door the trim outside the garage door haul away all the crap the previous owners left behind maybe rent a small dumpster for a week get the water softener fixed get the furnace checked out I ve also thought about buying a dish and flatware set that I like and maybe a new pot pan set That way L can take all the old stuff At swimming on Tuesday I had trouble concentrating on the lessons because I kept trying to think of a way to ask the instructor out to dinner Is it too soon Is she really involved with someone else or is that just something to put guys off It could just be a friendly dinner I am attracted to her and it s also partly that I want to have a date or appear to have a date I don t know why to affect L in some way

34	money really is everything isn t it Well I mean it s really just an abstract concept with such real consequences in this capitalistic society but I digress My upcoming divorce boils down to money How much are our marital assets worth The house stocks my retirement savings her retirement savings furniture our savings account and what money we owe on the heloc and the car Hopefully at most we split everything 50 50 and walk away from our relationship Then we just have to deal with the complications of custody and the kids and I have to figure how I can pay for everything with just my salary while she in turn pays for everything of hers with just her salary Housing in our area has skyrocketed so I decided with the advice of others of course that it would be best if I stayed in the house That will also mean less of an impact on the kids which I think is important I mean Ivy freaked out when I was simply moving furniture around in my bedroom Although I gotta say that the new layout is great with the bed under the window so I get fresh evening breezes only the ceiling fan is not lined up right I hardly feel it now maybe it s time for a free standing fan So anyway I have to figure out how I can keep paying my monster mortgage plus the bills and the new car And since she ll only be taking a portion of her share of the marital assets I ll have to figure out a payment plan to ensure she gets the rest of it I ll use the HELOC to get more immediate access to funds needed so that she can move out But in the end it s all just money I have to keep telling myself that I have to change my 401 k contributions so that I ll get more money in my paycheck so that I can pay all the bills I have to pay The next question is how should I pay for the matrix Should I tap the heloc 2 99 interest rate for the first 90 days should I sell stocks for a loss or should I finance it through other means 

34	Am I a fool Yes I suppose I am ECGI dropped again on high volume to as low as 44 then started to bounce back So what did I do I put in an order to buy more at 45 not sure if it will get filled but I think it s bottomed Of course I thought the same thing when I picked up more shares last week or was it 2 weeks ago at 61 

34	Everything is down today of course Fears of inflation spurs the fed to consider increasing interest rates which causes people to sell in the stock market driving prices down All my stocks except EMA are down Some day it will all turn around and I ll be up again Until then I ll just keep regretting not selling when I had the chance I m waiting for a positive profitable quarter and possible merger and acquisition news from ECGI I m waiting for news of funding independent of further stock dilution and news of contracts and or profits from RCO Those are my two biggest holdings I m of course tempted to buy more of both RCO and ECGI with the scant money I have left but deep down I think may retreat further 

34	I was just fantasizing about owning a new car I ve had my 1994 tercel for well nearly 10 years now My first car was a honda civic I think or an accord I paid too much for it and it needed repairs before it was road ready I kick myself for not looking at that other guy s toyota Anyway I was at the dealership over the weekend and the salesman gave me a fuck you price of 200 for the trade in I told him in that case I wouldn t be trading it in I then talked to another guy today who said that well the first guy didn t really give it an appraisal so it wasn t really accurate I told him Kelly Blue Book said 1300 trade in value and he said we ll see I think I ll hold onto it I saw the 94 tercel advertised for sale in the neighborhood of 2k so I think it s worth it to sell it privately Or maybe just hold onto it for whenever I need a spare car or if my parents come to visit It s worth more than I thought it was and maybe I ll sell it after the divorce so I can keep the money I also test drove a mazda3 5 door and I thought about the new 2005 Ford Focus 5 door See I got kids and it s a lot easier loading and unloading them for a 4 door car than a 2 door car Tercel And the hatchback is good for hauling gear Someday I ll really go on a camping trip The Mazda was a little more expensive but peppier The focus has an mp3 player option better financing options and is a little less expensive than the matrix But I m reluctant to buy American Japanese just seems more reliable to me Anyhow the ford dealership doesn t seem to have the five door in stock and I m tired of waiting and shopping and second guessing I want to buy now

34	I ve taken a beating in the stock market especially compared to last year when I was up 17k I made that money mostly by borrowing against my heloc to buy microcaps I hit it big with CTXS ATYT and BFUN Each of these tripled at least Chris Lahiji had reviewed 12000 microcap annual reports and recommended a bunch I chose a handful and they really paid off This year however I m down as much as I was up last year And after paying off the heloc I borrowed against it again RCO was trading at around 70 and I bought more What the fuck was I thinking Averaging up Jesus Next time I think about averaging up I have to remember to sell Sell 50 to 80 percent of my holdings Take profits Take the fucking money off the table I was up about 20k unrealized earlier this year and I got greedy thinking I could make even more I was looking the wrong way which I appear to be prone to do Nonetheless I m planning on putting myself further into debt real debt though by buying a urlLink 2005 Toyota Matrix I think I might have a gambling problem But it could also be a I don t give a shit problem Where sometimes I lose a lot of money or make stupid decisions both in present sight and hind sight because I really don t care about the outcome Of course I end up caring a lot later Linking the heloc with my brokerage account was probably not a good idea even though I did make out great last year So anyhow my portfolio currently consists of RCO ECGI IBZT CDED AVR EMA and USTT They are all microcaps and trading under a dollar I have too optimistic hopes and they ll likely be dashed But maybe I like how my dad put it that my wife will take 50 of my losses if I lose money Maybe I should feel a little good about that I d rather she share in the profits but then again fuck her 

34	Yeah I got netflix Very convenient Much better than paying late charges at blockbuster easier to browse for movies better selection than the library So over the weekend I just watched The Cider House Rules which I d seen before remembered it was good and decided to watch again It was still good the second time I think it got some oscars For some reason those tend to be good movies I also watched The Closet a hilarious french movie with english subtitles about a bore of a man about to get fired because he s so boring Gee I can relate to that it s not because he s boring but that he doesn t really talk to people at work I thought it was neat to see the office hell lifesteyle in French I also have Monsoon Wedding but didn t quite get around to watching that So I just returned the first two and should be getting two more later this week I m thinking of mixing up my queue so that I get Mostly Martha and Better Luck Tomorrow next Oh yeah this is my first post I wonder if anyone will stumble on me like I stumbled on Merthin I was thinking about how much I loathe my wife soon to be ex wife I guess I don t want to get into it now but I googled loathe and bumped into his blog I should thank him Maybe I ll start expressing myself every day I thought about writing a journal every day but usually I do that for a day or two and then skip a few months and admonish myself for having such a weak will 

34	So I m keeping the house I ll re finance the mortgage I called e trade yesterday and after some discussion we settled on re finance original loan for 295k 5 1 ARM interest only 5 375 initial rate Also HELOC will be reduced to max of 50k from recently increased 100k with a balance of roughly 40k Payment will be 1321 interest and 376 escrowed taxes and insurance for a total of 1697 Payment on the heloc will be roughly 180 Total is about 1900 That s not bad at all my current payment is about 2100 I thought for sure I d be paying more But the catch is the 5 1 ARM After 5 years the interest rate will jump a bit So the plan is either re finance or sell within 5 years I m sure my picture will be considerably clearer within 4 years The Long View Sept 05 Kid1 starts K 1 2 time in daycare Sept 06 Kid1 starts public school kid2 starts K 1 2 time in daycare Sept 07 Both kids in public school So I ll pay strictly interest for the first year maybe the first 2 years Then I ll be able to start making significant payments toward the principle I ll also be able to start putting money into my retirement again and start building the kids college funds After a year I will also look into making improvements to the house with the idea that I ll stay there longer than 5 years Plans for the house Put in a shed beneath the front steps Get a jungle gym for the kids Tear down the deck have it re designed with meandering pathways and rebuilt with eco friendly materials Get central air conditioning Build a patio at the side of the house complimenting the deck Build a room below the deck as an outdoor 3 season patio Build a gazebo steps pathways going down from patio and or deck Get a hot tub and a small in ground pool in the patio Build a treehouse or playhouse for the kids Re paint the outside of the house Get better storage options for inside garage get outside door installed to garage Get professional landscaping re decorate the living room paint the walls get some art re decorate the kitchen hardwood floor new counters new sink enlarge master bath remove walk in closet put in 2 person jacuzzi tub and larger windows If nothing else the house will be a great investment opportunity Wow I look at that list and start envisioning my house in a few years and I really like what I see Why would I want to sell 

34	Hmmmm I ll try to re capture my fleeting thoughts Am I afraid of being alone No Not to get philosphical but ultimately each of us is alone I think we re all trying to find someone to share our life experience with So while I m not afraid to be alone I would prefer to be sharing my life with someone beyond just myself We each came to meet one another most likely not at our ideal time I was originally focused on my situation and my history and my baggage for lack of a better word which I guess is natural because I see the world from my viewpoint primarily But my main concern was whether or not I was ready and whether or not I was good enough for you and a relationship with you I mean of course I m always judging what s going on around me seeing how it fits into my world But I didn t originally think about whether or not you were ready for a relationship or your situation and history or your baggage More of that stuff has come out how he wounded you and how you re coping with your past relationships childhood parents friendships all the things that you re dealing with and likewise you re trying to see how I fit into your world The key is for each of us to be completely honest with ourselves and with each other about everything we re feeling And that s rarely easy to do You were right when you said that I married young I definitely rushed into it and constantly regretted it I m going to be more careful this time around That means a longer dating period The key for me is to look beyond my infatuation to determine whether or not we ll be good long term as mates Laima was my first real long term relationship I was infatuated and I rushed into marriage Actually I was just excited that I found someone who was actually interested in me So while I m looking beyond the infatuation I m also working at not losing sight of or failing to experience those very infatuation related feelings because they feel great I ve really enjoyed our dating so far I feel really comfortable with you and I feel like you re looking out for my best interests I feel free I mean we went away together for the weekend and had a great time I was sick on Saturday and you were still accepting of me I don t recall having those feelings with L or particularly enjoying our dating back then There is some small part of me that is afraid of getting betrayed again of putting too much trust into another individual But that s all about me and nothing about you What I mean by that is that there is nothing you can say or do that will help me with these feelings and it has nothing to do with who you are or what you ve done in your past It s more of an issue that I need to work on At some point we ll stop seeing the world so much from our individual perspectives and we ll start seeing the world from our couple perspective As a team we ll tackle problems together we ll experience life together we ll share our individual experiences with each other we ll grow together Well I think I ve rambled on enough and gone in enough different directions 

34	S and I were sitting on a park bench talking to her mom Earlier in private I had been honest and forthcoming with her mom about S and I my marital situation how we were in love Now her mom was grilling us or at least upset with us for rushing into things S looked over at me with a pained look on her face saying that I d ruined everything I called S to discuss the dream with her She thought it was really weird because she and Mo had talked the night before about what story we should tell her siblings and her mom They agreed that total honesty could wait until later with regards to her mom but her sister could be told the truth For example how long have you been divorced That would be an awkward one S said that her family wants to meet me

34	I don t remember many dreams but I just woke up from this one so i just woke from this dream where S my brother not sure if it was P or another brother and I were sitting outside a house on a driveway kind of facing this cement wall leaning on a 45 degree angle kind of like an aqueduct There were wood chips covering the wall hiding it The sky looked ominous like immediately before a summer thunderstorm or immediately after The wall stretched down to infinity down a hill into the ocean but it was not all covered with the wood just the part near the driveway My brother was about to sweep off the wall and I asked what he was doing the wood chips looked good He said it would be better to sweep it off and maybe paint something on the wall I commented to S sometimes he s such an asshole Then I reflect on how my brother always got the girl that I was interested in She was my friend dammit We d been friends for years and I really felt a lot of love for her even though she was in a relationship with my brother I moved away from the wall as the brother proceded to sweep it I was on the deck porch of a house and I asked S to come talk to me I was about to tell her that I wished she were with me when I woke up and realized that she is already with me 

34	I was recently reading over some of the poetry I d written around the time of my getting married and after the marriage I remember feeling like I made a big mistake and that I wanted to get out I think I kept having those kind of thoughts for about 5 years When I think about that I think that maybe a higher power was communicating through my poetry but I ignored it I remember being very unhappy in the marriage In August 1993 I moved to connecticut In November 1993 we announced our intention to get married On 12 4 1993 I wrote Flash in the Pan about love burning brightly at first and then fading and me leaving On 2 16 1994 I wrote Lost Shoes about searching for a new path and temptation to get away On 10 10 1994 I wrote Union about our marriage and relationship positive for public consumption On 10 15 1994 we got married I remember thinking that if it doesn t work out I could always get a divorce On 6 24 1995 I wrote Dark Reflections about dwindling passions time passing us by dreams becoming memories On 8 12 1995 I wrote Secret Writings Part I about whether it s better to leave someone or to die On 8 24 1995 I wrote Clarity about someone coming to me and telling me that it s up to me and that it s my life I remember thinking about divorce then On 9 17 1995 I wrote two Divided and Mask One about how different L and I were and one about how I had already fled the relationship On 9 19 1995 I wrote They Slept On how we knew of our differences but both decided to ignore them and try to keep it together There were other poems too reflecting a general feeling a disquiet between 1996 and 1999 but they were vaguer and I can t specifically point to them and say they were about my relationship Did I become comfortable or did I feel I d said all there was to say So then I think about how my poetry dwindled after that Like the muse had tried to tell me things but I decided not to heed the voice Then in 1999 we decided to adopt For me at that point everything changed Somehow things were more positive I guess I stopped writing poetry until 2002 writing 3 and then stopping again until I wrote two last week So as I look back on my marriage and on past relationships I think about how I pull out of a relationship emotionally mentally but I don t take the steps to end it It s like I m just waiting the other person out It s been a bit of an eye opener for me Maybe I ll post these poems Depression rage turned inward That makes perfect sense I wanted to get out of the relationship didn t do anything about it and was angry with myself for letting it go on as long as it had 

34	I had tried a new template didn t like it and switched back to my original I think The new template made font sizes too big I felt it was nearly unreadable It also contained html code for links and stuff but I really don t need that on my blog site Let s see what s been going on in my world Geez my last real post was 7 14 Um S and I are still together still talking daily via phone and email still wishing we could see each other more often Will we go the distance Time will tell but we both have a strong feeling about it Her therapist is much more supportive of her than mine is of me But maybe mine is looking out for my best interests Thursday night I had yoga then worked for about 40 minutes moving a server from one rack to another then went on to S s house I had lied to L that I wasn t seeing S I was seeing someone else S made me grapes cheese salmon and potatoes for a late dinner Then we hung out in her room talking kissing fooling around and eventually sleeping The next morning I said that I should get back home to help get the kids up She was visibly upset and I told her if you ask me to stay I ll stay I had to repeat this before she asked I stayed While she got ready I took the dog for a walk and called L I ended up sleeping over at Michelle s house so I won t be around to help get the kids up this morning I felt so cool lying like that like oops I let her name slip out I don t know if she took the bait I was about 30 minutes late for work but it was great being with S Friday night L went out taking Ivy to a rennaissance festival in Ansonia I was meeting with realtors discussing how much they thought they could sell the house for and what houses I could look at over the weekend Then L came in saying that her friend was waiting in the car dumping a cranky Ivy in my lap to put to bed Gee that was a little awkward I had guests And the fucking realtors were taking their sweet time I should have told them to shut the fuck up give me the bottom line and let me put my daughter to bed My whole body was aching and I had a migraine coming on not a lot of fun The fucking realtors were on their way out but were talking to me from outside with the front door open Bugs were flying in annoying me to no end I put Ivy to bed and then I called Lisa who had returned my call I d asked her to go with me and the kids to the baseball game next Friday She was excited about the trip she d taken to Omega Institute where she roomed with a bitch who ignored the rules of no smoking and no alcohol and was in emotional therapy for her week Lisa was much more balanced and in for sign language Sounds like she had a great time She agreed to go to the baseball game so I m really happy about that It s really a huge relief for me One because I m not a big baseball fan that is I never watch and two because I was concerned about taking my two kids to the game by myself Lisa is so great Just as I was hanging up with Lisa S was calling on my cell She wasn t happy that I was talking to another woman about the baseball game Especially since I d admitted that I had been attracted to Lisa at one point You know what Too bad I invited S to the game and she d declined I tried to tell S that I no longer had any interest but this is her issue to deal with My body was aching horribly and my head was pounding I felt light headed dizzy nauseous and tired Maybe due to the 3 hours of sleep the previous night or that fact that I was on something of a starvation diet Saturday I was still quite achy The kids played most of the morning and we left around 11 to find a park to play at I had called S at around 8 30 but she was still asleep I called S again but her cell went to voice mail I didn t leave a message About 10 minutes later she called back I persuaded her to have a chance meeting with my kids we d be playing at a park near her house and she d come with her dog on a walk The meeting was great and it was great to see S even if we couldn t act as if we knew each other The kids loved her dog Afterwards maybe against her and my better judgement we took the kids to McDonalds for lunch and to play at their play area S was really good with Ivy coaxing her to eat all her lunch The only real contact we had was incidental I drove back and put the kids down for a nap I got them up around 5 made them some dinner PB J which they didn t eat then we took a bubble bath Ivy got soap in Aidan s eyes and that ended the bath for them I should have been paying closer attention My body was still aching a little and I started feeling queasy and

34	Hi I can t come to the phone right now because I m decapitated Leave a message and I ll return your call as soon as I get my head back on I just got a cell phone so I think that s the message I ll use on it I like to throw people for a loop 

34	My friend Vicki from college used to say that fortune cookie fortunes should be read with in bed added to the end Try it it makes them a lot funnier I just got one today A new friend helps you break out of an old routine in bed Ha Ha See isn t that funny 

34	Oh so I referred to things in motion at the beginning of the last post I ve decided that even though I can afford to keep the house I think I ll sell it primarily because of the psychic remnants of my broken marriage but also for financial reasons and because I don t want to work hard constantly to maintain the house and property and because I d love to live near the beach So I ll put the house on the market look for a new house I think I ll limit L to putting 20 down on her condo with money from the HELOC I may need to the HELOC to place a deposit on the house I ll be buying let s see 100k heloc 22k current debt 40k to L for her condo leaves 38k available in HELOC 23k sale of stocks 61k for my down payment Yeah that will work I mean it is my HELOC not OUR HELOC Then when the house is sold the money goes to pay off the heloc Did I ever mention that I ve lost 25 pounds over the past 6 months I think I did it by reducing my calorie intake and by exercising more Someone at work complimented me on the weight loss I still have another 10 20 pounds I want to lose and I know I just have to remain diligent in my efforts S also has some ideas to consider once I plateau I m also contacting another lawyer regarding a second opinion on my mediation so far I m still leaning back towards 50 50 split and no alimony I even think that she should cover some of the day care costs and regardless of whether that s going to happen she should cover on going child care expenses I think 50 50 is fair for ongoing expenses major expenses dental eye health and for college education Stuff with S that s in motion She decided against the baseball game with the kids but we ll go to RI for a reggae concert together that weekend instead I ll try to ask Mike or Lisa or maybe even Dean to join me for the game Then the week of 8 9 I have training in Norwich and will get a hotel I asked S to join me for each night That s it for now By moving into a less expensive place I ll have more cash available for other weekend trips 

34	I feel like things are in motion I feel that it s been some time since I felt this way I mean things were in motion when we adopted our kids definitely but I ve been feeling stagnant creatively and inspirationally for some time now It was frustrating these past 5 years or so not writing any poetry Why didn t I want to write poetry about my kids The poem from yesterday which I picked a title for TODAY was inspired by S by my weekend with her and even by conversation with her on Monday night I guess I need to rewind a bit since my last real post was on Thursday last week after the mediation and my second date with P While I was on the second date I could help but think about S I mean I got home from the date and after decompressing I called S and we talked for about 2 hours Just today I received an email back from P but well I guess I ll call her because I can t email her back and just let her know what s going on with me But I m getting ahead of myself again Rather than go camping Friday night directly after work I decided I really wanted to see S again so I altered my plans so that I d go camping on Saturday instead So Friday late afternoon I drove to Hamden and got my free cell phone and signed up for a calling plan When I got to her house she greeted me a little put off that I was early I thought she leaned in and give me a sensual kiss but later she said that I was the one who kissed her After the kiss I greeted her dog Sampson with real fervor petting him and being really playful with him He responded really positively and seemed really happy to meet me S had to finish getting ready so I sat in her room and looked at her stuff while she got ready I put on a Billie Holiday CD for a change of pace She was happily surprised to listen to something different I liked her eclectic collection of stuff from her teal chest to her computer table to the knick knacks on her bookshelf After she was ready we went out to eat I suggested Mexican and we got in her car We chatted in the car and after a while driving down one road she started to wonder if she d missed the restaurant She continued a little ways and then turned around Couldn t find it she felt a little embarrassed we went for pizza instead She got roasted red peppers on her half and I had a hawaiian pizza on my half ham and pineapple The waitress was hard of hearing and when I told her what I wanted she said do you want sauce do you want cheese and I was like of course I want that stuff but I also want the hawaiian and salad too After the pizza arrived the waitress asked if everything was okay did we want anything else and I said I d like to order drinks She started to walk away Uh hello S got a beer and I got a smirnoff ice After dinner we stopped at a grocery store because I wanted to get water for the camping trip and frozen yogurt for that night I wanted phish food but got fudge brownie instead ben jerry s of course Then we went back to the house and I met her sister Mo who is an INTP and a vegetarian She was nice friendly and soft spoken It ends up the Mexican restaurant was a little further down than we d gone We went upstairs to her room to talk and kiss and lay on her bed After a while we put on the DVD Pieces of April we continued to kiss passionately on the bed I told her about my feelings about sex that for me sex love sex commitment and commitment exclusive She felt maybe it would be best if we didn t have sex until after the divorce was final Yeah right For some reason I lost track of what the movie was about and it wasn t as funny as I was hoping We turned it off midway through and turned out the lights and continued to cuddle with each other and talk until around 1 30 I woke again around 4 30 and we fooled around some more Then I got up and left around 7 30 for the camping kayaking trip The drive took longer than I expected and I started to fear that the group would leave the campsite for the canoe kayak trip without me At around 9 15 I sent Rodney positive thoughts that I was coming maybe he would hear me I got to the campground at around 9 45 skipping check in They were waiting for me and were about to head out in 5 minutes Whew by 10 30 we were on the river John and I were in kayaks and everyone else was sharing a canoe 6 or 7 couples John was a bit of a hotshot in the kayak and I was clearly a novice but it didn t really matter because everyone else was hung over from partying the night before It was slow ride down the river a nice mix of slow patches and rapids No one seemed to want to make any effort to row By the end I was getting impatient and I went ahead of the group All throughout the trip I kept thinking about S and how much I wished she was out on the river with me Afterwards we got on a bus and were dropped off near our cars to drive back to the campground I stopped to check in for the campground and then drove back Once there I saw that most people had not come back one couple was about to go out and one couple was drinking beers near their tent I decided not to pitch my tent yet The campground was close to the road noisy I wasn t sure what I d do with myself I was feeling a little lonely I missed S and I wanted to talk to S but there was no cell phone service So I decided to drive until I found cell service Once in the car I was listening to Deep Forest and I was starting to feel really low and depressed and regretful about the decisions I d made in my life I cried in the car as my emotions overcame me I felt like there was a huge connection between me an S and for lack of a better word that we were soulmates Maybe I was crying because it felt so good to be in love again Or maybe I was feeling like I was rushing into things and I would have another relationship end in disaster Or maybe I was feeling I would inevitably make a bad decision again I may have also been feeling very introverted where I was running away from the campground where I was camping with a bunch of people I didn t know So while I was crying and looking at the beautiful vistas I was also feeling a little like driving off the vista ending everything Maybe it s like my emotions were just overwhelming and I didn t like being so out of control But I also felt like I had felt the tears coming on and I pushed myself to cry To cry for a lot of things because I typically can t cry and I wanted to encourage myself to release I got cell phone service and called S I asked what she was doing that night and whether it would be okay if I could come see her She said she d love to see me So I drove 2 5 hours back to Cheshire to see her I cried some more during the drive back I told her about my day and my crying in the car and some of my suicidal feeling I felt very vulnerable with her but felt I could trust her implicitly We got chinese food and then sat down on the couch to watch a movie with her sister I was feeling really drowsy and excused myself around 9 to get some sleep She came to bed around 11 30 or so and I woke up Again more talking kissing cuddling and fooling around We went to sleep around 1 30 and this time I woke around 4 30 and asked to use her computer to do some email and download some of my music to her computer When she woke up we talked and fooled around some more We kind of lazed around and then went out to breakfast around 11 After breakfast we took sampson for a walk I had to leave around 3 to get back home It was very hard to leave I had such a great weekend not having to deal with my other life 

34	DRIVE I smell you on my shirt but I can t find the exact place I just get a good whiff every once in a while I don t want to wear anything else today I feel your lips on my lips your tongue on tongue wet warm and delicious I just can t get enough of you You hold and caress my hands you touch and stroke my thigh everything feels so electric my body aches for you we will talk on the phone exchange emails but it s just not the same I want to be with you Simon Brighteyes 7 14 04 

34	TODAY with no action the best intentions are laid to waste with no goal on the horizon or no map from the heavens the ship is lost at sea why is today not the day there is a sense of inspiration a sense of immediacy and maybe even a sense of urgency Simon Brighteyes 7 13 04 I felt inspired after talking to S every day for the past 8 days This is the first time I ve been inspired in any way about poetry in the past 5 years S and I hit it off great this weekend I ll write more about it maybe tonight But this total honesty thing is working out like I never believed I can talk to S about anything and she can talk to me about anything I never experienced that before with anyone I have another date with her tonight after work go see Spiderman 2 then I ll take her to Bertucci s for dinner 

34	From Mom To me Subject Newsweek Article Date Fri 9 Jul 2004 20 40 16 0700 Did you read this weeks issue of Newsweek There is an article that you should give to L to read and discuss with you It describes her behavior to a T And it puts what she is doing into perspective with other things going on in her life Let me know what you think of it Love Mom xoxoxo Date Sun 11 Jul 2004 05 19 47 0700 PDT From me To Mom Subject re Newsweek Article I don t get newsweek anymore but a friend of mine forwarded me the link to the article and even though at first it was initially painful I did read it on Friday I was going to send you the link At this point I m not going to show her the article Frankly I don t really want to discuss it with her I agree that lots of stuff in the article fit her exactly The problem is that I can t trust her again and even if I could she doesn t want to do anything to try to regain my trust In the past 8 weeks she s gone on about 15 dates I ve gone on a few dates myself I was on a kayaking trip yesterday but the camping trip turned into a wash I spoke to an older couple while we ate lunch asking how long they d been married just 2 years They had each gone through divorce and she was talking about the resiliency of kids That kids see their ultimate role models their parents and however the parents are the kids often reflect that So they see that mom and dad broke up because their relationship didn t work out but that they still stayed friendly toward each other and worked together to build good households for their children They ll see that mom and dad then moved on to find mates that were more suitable for them Just like you and Dad did I look at each of your re marriages and I see how you found the right mate the second time around In fact your new mate is much better than your original mate was for you You and H share many of the same interests and your marriage reflects your compatibility With Dad and M it s the same way I hope the lesson learned by our children is that sometimes relationships don t work out but it s okay to break up and try again I ll take more time and care selecting my next spouse and make sure that we re more compatible keeping a realistic view of her good points and bad points I m not going to rush into anything but when I date I am not looking to just have fun I m not wired that way I m looking to see if we re compatible if we have similar interests what her past relationships were like and how they ended and whether I think she ll be a good lifelong mate and a good parent to my children On the dates I ve gone on so far I ve been totally honest with the women The first one was a very awkward date because I admitted I wasn t ready for a new relationship this one was during the first week of our separation Another one knew that I just needed a friend Another one blew off our date Two more I ve had 2nd dates with even though I was sure that they would see a man who was in the middle of a divorce and probably had issues he was working on and there was always the possibility in their eyes that I could go back to my spouse But they still wanted to see me again It used to hurt when L told me she was going out But now either I m jaded or I ve truly accepted it because now I don t hate her anymore I regret not getting to know L better before we got married We were never totally honest with one another and over time we both continued to withhold the truth from one another and eventually this form of lying destroyed our marriage The article did describe what happened in our relationship Kids were introduced into the picture and it drastically became less about us and more about the kids The time we spent together was primarily limited to getting the kids up in the morning or being with them in the evening feeding them bathing them getting them ready for bed And then by the time we were alone together she was exhausted and I just wanted some alone time Her idea of quality time together seemed to be sitting on the couch watching TV shows The vacations we took together were almost always about me visiting friends and family We didn t take enough time for each other That is a lesson I ve learned But I m going to take that lesson with me into my next relationship Well I ve rambled on enough here From Mom To Me Subject You ve Come a Long Way Baby Date Sun 11 Jul 2004 15 51 02 0700 I can t believe how well you can verbalize what has happened and what you plan to do differently You are processing things much faster than I had anticipated The same thing happened when I tried to talk with my Mom during my divorce I was continually trying to catch her up on what I d dealt with and she was someplace way back in my process What our conversations did help me to do was to organize my thoughts in a pragmatic sort of way The emotional rawness of the experience continued to be debilitating for quite some time however I distinctly remember having days when I was just hanging on and others when I felt truly optimistic about my future It took me about 2 1 2 years before I felt capable of handling whatever might come my way Part of that was financial because I had a tough time making it on the money I was earning and your Dad s child support payments I dated a number of people during that time and ran into people who were in various stages of the same recovery process I found that most of our married friends didn t want to take sides and some felt very threatened by our divorce like it was catching or that I might go after their husband My best support system I developed by going to Young Single Parents which offered companionship without dating and a wide variety of activities for just adults and some that included kids I hope you have a similar organization available in your area I continued group therapy for a year and that helped immensely in dealing with my emotions and issues on a weekly basis I also had several close friends and family to bounce things off of Having kids forces you to cope with crap that comes up even though having children complicates your recovery since you will have to continue a relationship with your ex for many many years Kids also complicate your forming relationships with other ladies ie don t bring your kids into your dating life until you are dating someone you really like Especially don t do sleepovers with a lady friend while your kids are home until you are pretty certain this person is really important in your life It s also helpful when working out your custody agreement to figure out a weekly visitation schedule as well as arrangements for holidays You ll need to build in a way to share the kids around holidays or simply alternate holidays to keep the schedule from getting frantic If you want to bounce ideas off me regarding this issue I ll be glad to tell what worked and didn t work for us Thanks for keeping me up to speed on your progress I know however that behind your words there are still some very raw and painful feelings I hope you can allow yourself to mourn the loss of this relationship while getting on with your life I love you Mom xoxoxo Date Sun 11 Jul 2004 17 31 09 0700 PDT From Me Subject Re You ve Come a Long Way Baby To Mom Mom Thanks for taking the time to write me back My therapist also feels that I ve come through a lot perhaps more quickly than she expected I still do have raw feelings and sometimes have trouble coping But maybe the times are different now and divorce is more commonplace and many adults my age have already experienced divorce either directly or with their parents Everyone knows someone who s divorced so it s less of a big deal and there s less of a stigma on divorced people I have several friends who have been very supportive and I ve been careful not to burden any one person with too much crap other than my therapist I ve been keeping a web log journal that helps me vent lots of anger and verbalize in a way all the feelings I m having This weekend when I was out camping and I had some time to myself I broke down and cried a good cry Despair and sadness and regret over everything that s happened It was good to let it out and to find strength from it I am concerned about finances post divorce but I m going to get a second opinion from another lawyer just to make sure I m not getting screwed out of what my fair share should be and what my expectations should be We ve now moved towards a more equitable sharing of time with the kids where I will have them two weekdays L will have them two weekdays and we ll switch off every other weekend we ll each have the kids about 50 of the time We also covered holidays and agreed that we would switch off with major holidays and just keep it so whoever has the kids on the weekend of a holiday gets the kids for that weekend The same will go for birthdays We tentatively also agreed that if one of us has a birthday party the other spouse will be invited Is it sad that I m looking forward to putting this custody agreement into effect as soon as possible We re already saying to each other that on our particular weeknights we re allowed to just make whatever plans we want and if we re around we ll help out with the kids but it s not required And this past weekend was my weekend next weekend is L s weekend But I m looking forward to being a part time dad in that I ll be free to have weekend getaways with friends or a girlfriend This year I will have the kids for Xmas and L has agreed that I can go to California for 10 days so that we can get visits in with you and Dad I m really looking forward to that actually Next year she ll get the kids I can t imagine it would be for 10 straight days so I m sure I ll see them for xmas eve at least So it was at first a little stressful thinking about how I d only see my kids half the time But after this weekend and after spending nights out not worrying about taking care of the kids it s something I m actually looking forward to I think the kids are young enough that they will learn this soon enough to be the routine and will adapt to it fairly quickly I think it s also good that they re at a young enough age where they ll adapt more quickly to a step mom or step dad even though that s at least 2 3 years out in the future Finance wise things will be a little tight the first couple of years while the kids are still in day care But I am making a good salary and I do have access to some savings Dad has also offered an advance on my projected inheritance But once they start grade school I believe expenses will drop dramatically I realize that there will be new costs associated with the kids like with after school programs or summer camps or increased amounts of clothes One thing I need to do is find a support group play group so that I can be more social with the kids Maybe I ll get in touch with Ivy s friends parents and arrange some play dates Thanks for listening 

34	Date Thu 8 Jul 2004 11 01 22 0400 GMT 04 00 From Dean To Simon Subject So tell me How was your conversation with S last night Speak man speak Date Thu 8 Jul 2004 08 24 18 0700 PDT From Simon To Dean Subject Re So tell me The conversation was great again We started to make plans for a date on Tuesday but I dunno I really like her so I m gonna see her Friday instead delaying my arrival for the camping until Saturday morning I m not sure how that s going to work logistically but I m going to her house to watch a video and get some dinner I also invited her to a date on 7 23 taking Ivy and Aidan to a Bridgeport Bluefish baseball game She just seems so right but maybe I m blinded to some things about her My therapist urges me to take it slow note red flags seek my ideal mate and not settle for less than that Being completely honest with her is a great feeling though L and I were clearly not completely honest with each other and it s been that way for some time We both adopted the policy of don t ask don t tell I think we were both frequently dissatisfied with our relationship but didn t discuss it maybe out of fear of hurting the other person I withheld my emotions and fears and regrets and stuff about money matters L and I were also talking about what to do for dates and we both got a good laugh about how we never really dated we just kind of fell into a relationship Our dates always consisted of a meal and a movie or a play But I still wonder if I really like S or if I like the idea of S I do feel stronger though that I ll stand up for what I want rather than giving in to make someone else happy But I have to be vigilant about that Date Thu 8 Jul 2004 13 58 53 0400 GMT 04 00 From Dean To Simon Subject Re So tell me What about just enjoying and being in the moment I agree with your therapist about heeding the red flags of which you have mentioned none but the notion of looking for the ideal mate seems to be a setup for failure The fact is no one is ideal even when one is not in an emotional mental state such as yours Your state of being right now might preclude certain measuring criteria Think of it this way You meet a guy named Bob You don t like Bob Bob starts telling you about his best friend Bill What information might you extrapolate from this Pythagorean Theory If Bob is an A hole and Bob s best friend is Bill it might be easy to hypothesize that Bill is an A hole as well While this might not be true it can be called upon logically You are in a state of mind right now where you are just getting to know yourself and coming out of a place where you have not liked yourself for a very long time Therefore if you do not like yourself subconsciously you are always second guessing anyone you do like because if you don t like you then how can you trust that the people you like are of good stock much less ideal This is especially true for you right now in intimate relationships You have consistently picked women who have done bad things to you betrayed you hurt you How can you trust that you wont make those same mistakes again The fact is you never can You have a certain schemata that you have built up over the years through which you filter information You are in the process of breaking that schemata down and rebuilding it but in the meantime it is what you have to guide you through the world Many times what we expect to happen happens simply because we expect it and therefore make it happen My suggestion to you in this very critical time of transition and major change both inside and out is to enjoy yourself Enjoy the people you spend time with Be open to experience Even be open to love and falling in love You are just starting to remove the blinders and when the storm clears the people who you love who also love you will still be there the others might have moved on Just make sure that if you push them away that you are doing so for the right reasons Given everything I have said the right reasons might seem obscured by the clouds and difficult to parse out from the minutia Just know that your ideal is an ever changing thing right now Be true to yourself Be honest with yourself and others and while your heart might be bruised and battered it is still beating in your chest and should have a say in matters as well as your brain even in it s damaged state OK I have rambled hopefully somewhat coherently Call me later Date Fri 9 Jul 2004 06 30 57 0700 PDT From Simon To Dean Subject Re So tell me Thank you very much for this mail note I ve read it a couple of times already and I appreciate your insight and your rambling The date with P last night was fun but I guess we were a little rushed at our picnic to get to yoga And then when yoga was over it was just kind of time to go It would have been more romantic if we didn t have yoga to go to but I think she enjoyed it I got a nice kiss at the end But when I got home all I wanted to do was talk to S I called her and we talked for about 45 minutes and firmed up our date for tonight I liked what you said about being open to love and falling in love I m going to stop trying to figure out where I m going and stop trying to figure out at least this early on what I m feeling I m just going to go and I m just going to feel I just have to remember to be who I am do what I want to do and say what I want to say And not be afraid that someone is not going to like me for any of those things I ve gotten used to quelling who I am what I want to do and saying what I want to say for fear of rocking the boat All this leaves me with the thought of what should I do about P Maybe it s easier because she s moving to the white plains area soon 1 2 weeks On our date we talked a little about the flags that came up for me in our last date her telling me what to do simple things like I m waiting at a stop sign and she tells me to go right not from directions but that s the way that she wants to go or her accentuating the generation gap that she saw but I didn t Should I just wait for her to call me to do something again or should I call her and tell her that I m seeing someone else She also just seems so adult so mature Much more than I feel But maybe that s just my perception since she s older 

34	Okay Running the spreadsheet helps me not freak out so much I also have to remember that the time split for how much time we have with the kids is about 50 each They ll be picked up by L and kept overnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays and every other weekend Friday through Sunday The ll be back Sunday nights We also discussed holidays briefly at the mediation Elaine said we should have a schedule but L and I were saying that we ll be flexible In general we ll switch off major holiday breaks xmas and thanksgiving Other holidays whatever day they fall on who ever has the kids that day gets the holiday Open to negotiation of course Birthdays the same maybe joint activities where the other parent is invited for the festivities So like I said running the spreadsheet shows hardship the first year Maybe I can push alimony off until the 2nd year where it will be 1 2 and then when both kids are in public school free I ll pay the full amount The trade off for this could be she pays no child support or it s baked into the alimony But I do want a stipulation for college where she pays 1 2 tuition fees and housing The good thing about alimony is that if L lives with someone else the alimony is ended I can use the heloc loan as a negotiating tool I m okay with the 55 45 split especially since a decent chunk of the money will be covered by sale of stocks and xfer of 401k So if I can delay alimony then year 1 will be difficult but not impossible Then year 2 I ll start paying alimony but day care costs will be halved Right Or will Ivy go to kindergarten and then have to do some kind of half day day care So is it really 3 years out before all kids are free and clear from paid day care 

34	L and I met with the mediator yesterday We had had discussions and I had made some financial assumptions Neither seemed to fall my way I feel like I m getting screwed I feel like I should talk to another lawyer because I feel like L and I come to an informal agreement and then the mediator throws in a wrench changing everything I feel like I m getting screwed Nothing is signed yet of course But now it looks like instead of a 50 50 split it will be a 55 45 split with L getting 7 years of alimony And I ll be paying all of day care Just the day care alone means that it s unlikely I ll be able to keep the house L was saying all she really wants is for me to help her get the condo Did I already say that I feel like I m getting screwed Now the only good part of alimony is that it comes off my income and goes onto L s income hmmmmm yeah that s about the only good part of it So now I m back to thinking I m going to have to move Except now I m also thinking that I ll need to get a condo not a house because that s all I ll be able to afford Plus do I really have the time or the inclination to do all the upkeep on the house I don t really know But I don t think so I mean on the nights that I have the kids I ll want to be with the kids And the nights that I have free I ll want to go out The other thought I had though was that I could keep the house and simply be paying out more than I m taking in until the kids are out of day care 1 year 1 kid out 2 years 2 kids out Then I m saving tremendously on day care costs I ll sell my Tercel I need to do a graph to figure out when I d start breaking even and how much savings I d eat up in the 1st year and in the 2nd year Because if it s breaking even after one year and then going back to the plus side in 2 years maybe it s worth it to keep the house I also didn t realize that the 401k funds could be transferred penalty free to L via some legal proceeding That s good in that I could take a 22k of her end straight out of my retirement Then I cash out my stocks for another 23k I gotta do some more spreadsheets I just got a call from e trade heloc increase approved 

34	My date with P last night was nice She was a little late but I almost expected that what with commuter traffic at rush hour and coming to a place she d never been to before I made salad dressing oil vinegar minced shallots honey and dijon to go with a salad of mediterranean greens pear honey roasted almonds and gorgonzola I stopped at the liquor store for a bottle of red wine I had no idea what to get because red wine is not my favorite but P likes it When she arrived I gave her a quick peck on the lips and then we got our stuff together and found a shady spot to sit We sat on opposite sides of the blanket and started to place food between us All throughout the meal I thought about how it was a physical barrier P brought cheese crackers and fresh fruit All of it was delicious and made for a good meal We talked a lot about careers continuing education and possible future careers I did not particularly like the wine and I don t think she liked it much either After we had finished eating we had about 15 minutes to spare before needing to leave for yoga That wasn t much time for anything romantic Lessons Learned sit side by side and array food in front of us choose a beverage we will both equally enjoy don t plan an activity immediately following the picnic Yoga was good P changed in the bathroom while I changed unabashedly in the living room V was already downstairs getting ready It was just the three of us The only downside was that when we were doing meditational exercises I started to drift off towards sleep After yoga V said that there would be no tea fruit because she had dinner plans So P and I went back outside and she showed me some pictures of her bike trip to ireland After the pictures we kissed with tongue passionately Did I break it off Could it have gone towards something more I m not sure I m not sure if she wanted more But I was sure that I didn t want more I had decided maybe sometime during the evening or more likely even before the date that I really wanted S When I got home L was up and we chatted a little about the date Then I checked my email and re read notes from D and S I decided to give S a call I called her at home and her sister said that she was out My heart skipped a beat I called her cell phone and she picked up after a ring or two She was on her way home from a friends house We chatted for 30 45 minutes and firmed up plans for me to come to her place for a date tonight I told her that I wanted to sleep over but that if she felt uncomfortable I could sleep on the couch I went to sleep thinking about her and about my camping trip that will start on Saturday instead of Friday No ambien again I woke around 4 feeling very horny A raging hard on I just lay in bed thinking about S enjoying the hard on untouched I haven t masturbated since Saturday which up until then could be considered a long time After I had talked to Sue I was no longer interested in masturbating I wanted to save myself for when I was with her During our phone conversation the night before we had danced around sex talk without overtly saying it She referenced her dirty mind on more than one occasion She had said that if I slept in her bed she didn t know if she d be able to keep her hands off me I can t remember the last time someone said that about me So I m looking forward to tonight I m not bringing any protection because I m disease free and infertile If she s not well then that introduces a problem Regardless I don t want to make any assumptions in fact I think sex would confuse things or make me feel like we re in love Because for me sex love I think it s that way with a lot of women too I also believe that sex commitment I also believe commitment monogamy I m not sure where fooling around goes I packed up stuff for the camping trip deciding not to bring my stove I figure I can boil water on someone elses stove for my chicken teryaki meal And I ll bring sandwiches And I ll bring some hard cider and of course water to drink I m a little nervous about kayaking on the river I m a little nervous about camping and being with co workers I m a little nervous about not sleeping well I ll probably take an ambien just in case 

34	I showed up to my therapy appointment 30 minutes early but Mo said it was okay she was about to sit down to eat but we could do the session while she ate Then she offered me a plate swordfish brown rice and asparagus It was all very good I told Mo about my recent dating activities and that I was concerned that I liked the idea of the people I was dating rather than the people themselves She didn t really have an answer for me on that but that it was something I would need to stay in touch with and determine for myself She advised me to watch out for red flags to make sure that I didn t get with a woman who was controlling and to just take note of any things about the woman that I thought were things I didn t like or things that would annoy me over time I think Mo wants to make sure that I don t settle for someone just because I think that I m not worthy of my view of the perfect woman for me After the session I drove to 500 Blake Street it was very easy to find and just a short ride from Mo s house I waited just a few minutes and then S showed up I greeted her in the parking lot with a hug We went inside and got a table and some menus We talked a little I didn t really feel nervous at all I found her more attractive than I expected that her pictures didn t do her justice We talked and ate and I think we were both completely honest with each other It was refreshing to be able to talk about anything without fearing something We talked about details of some past dating relationships her family squabbles and some family history We talked freely about feelings of depression and sometimes suicide religion and therapy We have similar views on life relationships and religion I just felt like we connected so well on so many different levels I like how much she laughs and smiles They kicked us out of the dining area sending us down to the bar but it was a bit chilly down there I suggested we go outside and we sat in my car for another hour or so just talking It was getting late and I said that we should end the evening because I was getting tired She got out of the car and into her car and then rolled down the window and said hold on I want to tell you something She then leaned over into my car and I leaned over and gave her a kiss It was a wonderful kiss and she returned it The only thing I didn t like is that I felt like I had cotton mouth from talking so much I was probably a bit forward in asking her to go camping this weekend I was probably also looking too far ahead when I mentioned the baseball game on 7 23 I figured she d be into it because she likes the Red Sox And it would be a good chance for her to see my kids in a casual meeting I drove home and couldn t stop smiling I went to sleep without an Ambien hoping I would sleep the whole night through But I woke at 3 30 Ivy was having a nightmare and needed to be consoled I emailed S and then I also realized that I forgot to do the SAP backups so I went downstairs and VPN d in to do that During the day I received emails from M and P I didn t call M regarding breakfast I think I ll just email her and say that I ve met someone I really like S and want to see her again already But I was surprised to hear back from P and I followed through on setting up a date with her for today Thursday a picnic at Boothe Memorial park in Stratford I ll make a salad and dressing and buy a bottle of wine She s going to bring some cheese and crackers and some fruit After the picnic we ll go to yoga S emailed me back that afternoon including a poem that she wrote about her father when she was back in college Then we talked again last night for about 2 hours It was probably a mistake to tell her about the date I had with P but I didn t want to withhold the truth or lie about it She declined the camping trip which is probably best We agreed to get together on Tuesday next week We both thought it was weird that we wouldn t talk for a few days after so much initial intensity So I decided that I d go to her house on Friday kind of on my way to camping I m not exactly sure where it s leading because I d likely stay overnight I don t want sex yet and I don t think we should rush into it because it will complicate everything It s weird going from getting blown off for a date and feeling so down about everything to meeting two people I felt I connected with so well in the space of a week or 3 people if I count Lisa from Saturday And even after I was honest with each of them about my current life situation they both want to see me again The downside with P is that she is a little older and her manner exudes it I guess I remember her saying on a few occasions that we were of different generations She just seems more adult for some reason She s also moving in a couple weeks to the White Plains NY area and so she ll be less accessible I was originally excited that she lived so close by The upsides with P include that I get a sense that she s very physically active that she enjoys bike riding a big plus S has knee problems and has some difficulty and pain hiking and bike riding That s a bit of a downer for me but she communicates on the same level as me and we have a lot of shared feelings and shared understanding So two more dates this week Thursday with P and Friday with S I feel a little weird about the one with P I smile just thinking about how easily S laughs Of course it s possible that neither is right for me or that I m really not ready to be dating and or starting a new relationship Lots to mull over Ug We re going to the mediator today to discuss financial stuff about the divorce All that stuff is still very complicated but I m not so worried about it any more 

34	So I called S over the weekend while she was visiting her sister in RI When I called she was on her way out and couldn t talk long So it felt short and awkward She emailed me on Monday when she got back into town and asked that I call her after I put the kids to bed so that she wouldn t wake them with the phone I called her at around 8 30 and we talked for about 2 hours I think we got along very well on the phone She s agreed to meet me tonight for a drink or whatever after my therapy appointment That works out well for me the restaurant we re meeting at is within 15 minutes of Mo s house so that works I came clean with S about my lack of a tattoo because I believe in being honest I can t believe I put that in my profile in the first place And then she asked me about it in one her first emails I just ignored the question and removed it from my profile She said that she later looked at my profile and saw that I had no body art and she felt like an ass for asking me But then she asked me what else I lied about in my profile Well I stated that I m divorced but I m really going through the proceedings now I feel justified saying I m divorced because there s no chance that we re getting back together vs separated where there s that chance Also I think Dean put in my profile that I read Da Vinci Code when I actually haven t I think Dean also said that sometimes I read as many as three books at a time but really I don t read much at all Maybe it s accurate The real answer is that I start many books and finish few So I ll do another post after our date 

34	L found a condo that she wants to buy She put 2k down on Friday and then told me that she ll need another 19k in two weeks I told her that since we re re financing the heloc there s no way I can guarantee we ll have the checks available to write to get that money for her I also told her they probably want a bank check and depositing funds from the heloc will take 3 days to clear So then she responded that I ll need to sell my stocks so she can get the money To which I responded no way I told her to email the mediator about her plans but she neglected to mention the 19k So I replied all and mentioned it for her I also offered the alternative funding from her parents temporary loan She was livid that I even mentioned that She said that there was no way she was going to ask her parents to help her To which I responded that there was no way I was going to sell my stocks She said half that money is hers And I said half of it is hers once the divorce is final Then she said that I was trying to screw her over regarding the condo Like now it s my fault that we don t have the money for her to move out I had no idea that she was going to need so much of the down payment so soon How would I know that Isn t that money supposed to come at the closing Maybe not Regardless she didn t get these details or at least communicate them to me when she made the initial offer on the condo That s not my fault My parents tell me don t do her any favors don t loan her money out of the heloc Dean thinks I should get her out of the house as soon as possible Since I want to work things out amicably I tend to agree with Dean I just have to make sure that everything is documented that she s taking money out of our accounts in order to buy a new place She also had the nerve to say to me that several weeks ago she talked to me about alimony and said that she would drop the alimony if I helped her find a condo We never had that conversation This was the first I heard it Frankly I m all for helping her find a condo And of course I m all for not paying alimony Nonetheless I told her that if she sought alimony I would hire a lawyer and go to court i e things would get messy She seems to be afraid of messy for some reason She wants to be buddies with me Fuck that Once this is over she will be nothing to me This morning she also started to suggest that we solidify our visitation agreement So that she has a more concrete schedule On her days she ll get the kids up and take care of everything and on my days I ll take care of everything That s easy for her to say she lives in the basement and the kids are right near me Like I d ever get to sleep in Then she also mentioned that this guy that she s seeing Ozzie has a visitation agreement where he sees his son on Wednesday and Thurday and every other weekend She said she wanted her visitation to be in line with his I stood my ground wiht Tuesday and Thursday I ve already modified my life to meet that schedule Why should I change my schedule so that she can be on the same schedule as the guy of the moment Plus not seeing the kids Wednesday through Sunday would be harder I think Then I also brought up how when she has the kids they should sleep over at her place so that I have some free time In general she was in agreement with that but she had concerns about getting the kids to school on days when she was working She offered that maybe she d have the kids more during the times that she had off It s funny how much we re talking and discussing these important matters I think she was livid with me about the financing because I was taking a stand and she wasn t used to that She s not used to me taking a stand and staying my ground She also started to talk about how she wasn t sure how she d come up with the child support payment after her mortgage taxes common fees I just did a quick calculation on etrade com where her mortgage would be 930 common charges she said were 170 and taxes 3000 year 250 month That s about 1350 month Ye gads Regardless of that cost she needs to pay for half of child care which is about 750 month 175 week kid x 2 kids x 4 3 weeks month 1505 month 2 people 752 person And that s just day care But if she s taking the kids overnight then it seems fair Because she will also need to clothe feed and house them Her finances will definitely be tight though You know what she needs A man with a second a income wait a second So interest rates are coming down That s a good thing for everyone I suppose I need to re finance my mortgage and get her name off of it I probably ought to talk to mortgage lawyer to see how it s done I think I need to find the original mortgage documentation to get L off the loan and then I ll need to re finance I m not sure how that will work exactly One step at a time I guess L just called saying that her realtor said not to worry about the deposit that it can wait until after we re fi the heloc I just ran some numbers in a loan calculator and might suggest to L that she only does 20 down or 42k Her payment will go up 50 month but she ll have another 8k cash I m not sure how much our divided settlement will be so it may be a moot point 

34	What am I going to do when my supply of Ambien runs out 

34	It s a basic MBTI test and maybe since I knew what I was already I answered the questions 4 to arrive at my expected personality type Actually when I ve taken the MBTI in the past my scales are usually in between INTP and INFP It s scary how either of these personality types fit me so accurately I say scary because MBTI only has 16 personality types and it s always nice to believe that we re so much more unique individuals than that There are good links on these two pages describing more about the personality types and their meanings in different facets of life Reading about my strengths and weaknesses in relationships for example is both re affirming and eye opening somewhat contradictory nonetheless true My urlLink Bloginality is urlLink INTP Or maybe My urlLink Bloginality is urlLink INFP 

34	I just finished watching the movie Touching The Void which is a documentary of two friends Simon and Joe who go on a mountain expedition in Peru and their plans go awry to put it mildly I took the movie to be a lesson in overcoming despair Any situation that I ll likely face in my lifetime will pale in comparison to the desparate situation that Joe experienced on the mountain From the comfort of my house I can call it a metaphor for a life obstacle that can be overcome basically by focusing on each little step that is required in order to reach the big picture But never really focusing on the big picture because it will be too overwhelming So for me my life obstacle is rebuilding my life after divorce 

34	So last night I took an Ambien conked out around and slept soundly until my daughter woke me around 6 or 6 30 That was fine She watched a little TV with me until I turned it off gogde it hadke to writke when Im lying down om y stomach I ll try to type a little more clearly Out of a big bag of chocolate chips we had about 2 3 cup left Not much to go on That s about 1 3 the recipe on the back of the tollhouse package So let s see what is 1 3 of 3 4 that s easy 1 4 What is 1 3 of 2 1 4 cups flour That is 1 3 of 9 4 cup of flour again easy 3 4c Here a harder one A cup of butter consists of two equal sticks 8 tbsp each How do I get a 1 3 of that Rather than take 1 3 of each stick take 2 3 of one stick leave the other alone 2 3 66 5 8 62 so I need a little more that 5tbsp of butter I can t believe it s not butter Then the hardest one 1 3 of 2 eggs Again a diet substitue using fake eggs the have a more markting friendly name 1 carton contain 2 eggs So I want 1 3 the carton whch hold 1 2c of liquid 1 6 cup I broke it down to the number of tablepoons using butter as the baseline so I use 2 full tbsp and about 2 3 a portion of a tbsp I think was right The cookies came out great and Ivy had a fun time make them with me and licking the batter from the mixer and from the bowl While they baked I saw that Lisa had called around 9pm but no message caller ID I called her back and maybe woke here I aksed to join her for temple which was meeting 8 off Park ave L said it would be fine while she took care of the kids I guess Saturday was my day I met Lisa at temple and went in sat next to each other She introduced me to serverl other poeple that she knows at the temple Then they read and chanted from the hymnal Everyone was friends a probably wondering if I was Lisa new boyfriend After that I tried to persuad her to let me into it apartmet to change but she refused on grouds that her home was a message I kept pushing when I should have just let it to I waited outside for a few minutes then she joined me in my car and we drove to the meeting spot in trumbull We hiked on the pequonnock river valley trails About halfway in Debi wa tired and ready to head back We crossed over the strdy brdge to the other side where it s a lot of walker and runners and bikes casual and serious It s a bit less that it our trail By the time we got to the bottom they realized that w ed need to walk back daniels farm road to the lot to get our cars It was fun but I would have prefered to stay on the side of the road with the real trails Aftr the hike Lisa and I had lunch at bloodroot I had vegan burger sandwich rosemary chipe small salad apple raspberry juice and an water After that Lisa invited me to see Fahreneit 9 11 with friends from temple We were a little last and when I didnt see lisa I was tempted to go see spiderman 2 But then Lisa popped out and had me sit with her between some cuouples After the show we all went to Circle Diner to discuss politics the movie and local events I had 1 2 phlly cheese steak dipped in au jus Some onion ring And a great chocolate shake The food was surprisingly good for a diner I thought Then we made our separate ways and I drove home I wathed a little tv and then went to bed consiously taking no ambien So went to sleep and woke at 1 30 I laid here for a minute and popped on the TV I masturbated eved though I schould control that need desire sh that on to perform something bad doesnt happen Then I thought I d take an amdien I also watched more TV Until taxi driver ended at 2 30 or 3 Them I started to get dreary and I ll work a little i sense a woman at my lamp looking down at me Drifing faster nw ver had t type afccuratels driffit going to bed 

34	Porcelain by Moby The Beach Soundtrack Costa Rica again but this time feels sad and reminds me of the sad feelings and feelings of the end of a chapter in my life Of L lying to me and hurting me over and over again In my dreams I m dying all the time As I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me In my dreams I m jealous all the time As I wake I m going out of my mind Going out of my mind 

34	Beached by Orbital The Beach Soundtrack for me it brings back memories of my Costa Rica vacation and it feels inspirational trust me it s paradise this is where the hungry come to feed for mine is a generation that circles the globe in search of something we haven t tried before so never refuse an invitation never resist the unfamiliar never fail to be polite and never outstay your welcome just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts you know what it s probably worth it you hope and you dream but you never believe that something is going to happen to you not like it does in the movies and when it actually does you expect it to feel different more visceral more real I was waiting for it to hit me hit me I still believe in paradise but now at least I know it s not someplace you can look for because it s not where you go it s how you feel for a moment in your life if you find that moment it lasts forever it lasts forever 

34	Sometimes I feel that I have a public image to maintain where I need to remain calm and cool and keep my anger and frustration and sadness inside Sometimes I feel I should let it out but then I think about my life and the difficulty I have had in expressing anger or sadness publicly I don t want anyone to be pitying me or trying to support me Like I feel I can do it on my own and I don t need anybody But I think deep down I really do need other people And I really do need to vent and to be supported I think one of the things that caused my marriage to stagnate was that I stopped expressing my feelings that I repressed a lot I never really blew up at L when I found out she had the affair Instead I immediately went into a depressed feeling like why is this happening to me Even before that with kids as I m sure you know we would spend a vast majority of our energy on being with the kids disciplining feeding cleaning playing teaching such that we didn t have a whole lot of energy for each other when they were finally put down to bed In the last couple of years and maybe longer there was less romance less excitement in the marriage I figured this out after it was too late If she ever figured it out she didn t make any effort to change either Regarding the truth we each have our own perception of it of course My mother in law tells it like it is or as she sees it and it pretty much pisses everyone off I just bought a new car and at first she said nice car but then immediately followed up by saying you now the dark blue color is going to show dirt very easily you re going to have to wash it a lot At that point I had nothing nice to say and I was trying to get the kids in the car without them running into the parking lot so I didn t say anything I think it s part of my belief system that if you don t have anything nice to say then don t say anything But in a way not saying what I m feeling is withholding the truth And in a way that s lying I have mixed feelings on it because L withheld information from me all the time she wasn t specifically lying about where she was but she wasn t exactly forthcoming either I think it s important to be forthcoming with the people that matter the most to you But actions speak louder than words as they say and I believe I m quite the hypocrite there My personal coach says that a white lie is still a lie My step father would agree He had lots of names for lying and I remember one in particular sugar coating I went on a date last night with P We were originally just going to go for a walk before I went to my yoga class but yoga was cancelled so we were able to do dinner walk on the beach sit at the beach and then dessert It went about 5 hours I m attracted to her but I wonder if it s P I m attracted to or the idea of P She s a little older 37 and has never been married But she asked me questions and I couldn t tell a lie I told her the truth about why we adopted kids my infertility that I wasn t truly divorced yet that I was attracted to her that I wanted to kiss her It s been a long time since I went on a date A very long time In fact I don t know if I ve ever really dated it s more that I fall into a relationship So I was at times very nervous and when I m nervous I tend to smile and laugh what is that nervous hysteria I told her I wanted to kiss her and she asked really But I didn t kiss her Then a bit later in the conversation she said you can kiss me if you want But it didn t feel right or spontaneous any more so I didn t Instead I waited until the end of the evening and leaned in for a quick kiss To which she responded you re cute I don t know exactly how to take that But I stirred when I kissed her if you know what I mean I told her I had a great time and that I d like to see her again She responded that she d like to see me again too I felt a little surprised by that because I know that she felt that I was too close to the divorce to be going into another relationship But I don t know maybe her clock is ticking Or maybe just maybe she really likes me

34	I mean think about it What would be so bad about just getting up right now leaving this training and going to the beach The only thing I can think of is the possibility of getting fired from my job Would that be so bad Sometimes when something drastic happens it acts as a catalyst for creating a rippling effect causing other changes What would happen if I lost my job The obvious answer is that I would get a new one of course But what would I do More of the same Would I be able to immerse myself in a job doing the same thing but at a different company If so what would have changed Another path I could go down would be sell the house and move someplace cheaper Re train for something I really want to do The problem is I don t really know what I really want to do Counsel teens Graphic design Interior design Poetry Make music Cook Maybe get back into IT but from a consultant perspective Doing odd jobs for small to medium sized companies Kind of like what that psychic was saying that I d work independently sometime in the next year If my cost of living was lower then I could afford to make less money and maybe enjoy my life more What activities do I enjoy yoga walking hiking camping theoretically biking kayaking canoeing swimming theoretically What interests do I have environment politics limited belief systems volunteer work vegetarianism animal rights suicide teen hotline I d like to try painting I was thinking about buying S the book What Color is My Parachute but maybe that s a book I should be looking at to determine what I really want to be doing with my life What transferable skills do I have that I could apply somewhere else and still eke out a living How low can I get my monthly expenses and still enjoy my lifestyle

34	So in addition to working my somewhat regular hours on Monday 10a 4p I also volunteered to work 10pm to 6am on a SEV1 project It was at times quite hard to stay awake and I even fell asleep a couple of times but finally 6am came I immediately went to bed and slept about an hour before Ivy and Aidan came in and woke me up I then groggily talked to them not really hearing them when they complained or said they were hungry I was really out of it I changed Aidan and got lunches ready for the kids Then I did dishes from last night When L took the kids to school I finished up the dishes and went to bed But then I wasn t tired I watched a little TV talked to S on the phone and eventually got drowsy I slept until around 11 30 when I heard the dog barking and someone outside oh Culligan was here to fix the water softener 115 and an hour later the softener appears to be fixed We should expect less hard water within a week I should expect to refill the salt sometime in the next 2 3 weeks Then I showered and got ready for work I also worked on Sunday night doing SAP backups for about 4 hours And last night part of my phone shift was also doing SAP backups which helped to pass the time at least Tonight Wednesday and Thursday more SAP backups But I ve setup my laptop now and I can do all that stuff remotely Since S has WLAN I can do it from her place sweet I m also on call this week and I m trying to figure out what day to take a comp day It s complicated by other people taking comp days vacation days and more phone shifts It looks like Thursday Steve and Rich are taking off And Friday Steve s on vacation Rich s phone shift starts at 2 John usually takes off at 2 and I got the appraisal guy coming at 2 30 So maybe Wednesday would be a better day for a comp day Then I could just see S tonight and sleep over tonight lazing about tomorrow taking in lunch and some shopping I ll have to pose it to S to see what she thinks We could still do a date Friday night of course Also I was thining on the way to work today that really our anniversary would be on August 9th since that s the day that we committed to each other as opposed to our first date Hmmmmmm S is going to follow Mo s suggestions for cleansing her system since she s plateaued on weight loss I d also like to follow a strict regimen for a diet I realize though that a big reason that I ve plateaued is that I m not exercising nearly enough I also need to work tonight putting that fucking parallel port card in that fucking server I m so sick of all the loops I have to jump through for these change controls I was going to see S nearly immediately after work but now I ll be delayed at least a little while I take care of the change control I ve pushed it to 5 15 with customer approval and fuck you to anybody who says I can t do it then Work change controls on call all that gets very complicated when I throw custody visition with kids into the mix I can t really be on call at the same time that I have kids sleeping at the house because if I need to leave to go on site I can t because then I d leave the kids home alone Rich has offered to work with me on that but I d prefer to have it worked out as part of my divorce agreement

34	Life or maybe just this past weekend is now about how I plan to use my time with the kids Saturday I took the kids to the Silver Sands beach in Milford for a couple of hours Aidan was so cute the way he cried and screamed whenever a little bit of slimy seaweed brushed past his foot He was paralyzed and wouldn t take any step towards any seaweed In the mean time Ivy was having a blast laying down in the sand in the shallow waves just running around having a good time I setup a large towel as our home base We ate snacks and drank juice watching as the tide came in I tried digging holes but the sand was too riddled with broken seashells The kids didn t put up too much of a fight when it was time to go We went home and I made them some lunch then put them down for a nap That afternoon after their nap I took them outside to play in our kiddie pool The water was way too cold at first but soon enough Ivy and Aidan were in there splashing each other and me I took some pictures Around 5 I took them in and I made dinner while they played in the living room On Sunday I was rushing around trying to get ready but there were so many things to remember and then I saw that the sky was threatening rain imminently I was worried that our day at Peter s pool would not work out For some foolish reason I decided to do a huge load of laundry I knew I was definitely going to be late and I thought about calling peter and just cancelling the whole thing I was starting to feel downright dismayed Then S called and just the sound of her voice was very calming to me We chatted for a few minutes and then I went back inside to call peter He had called while I was on the cell and I called him back Let s delay an hour to see how the weather looks I was amazed that he d mirrored my thoughts An hour later we got in the car and left right in the middle of a downpour Peter s was fun The kids were shy at first but warmed up Aidan had a blast riding a rocking horse It was an amazing relief from staying home alone with the kids or thinking up stuff for them to do After playing for a while we took them to BK for lunch and then to their play area I crawled in too even though adults aren t generally allowed I helped all the kids Peter s and mine find the big purple slide but it was a bit of a letdown because it wasn t slippery enough Then we drove home I didn t lay them down for a nap because it was around 3 that we got home Instead I laid down on my bed and Aidan joined me I napped a little while he played quietly S is in DE so while it s been hard not to see her it s not bad because it s physically impossible I m looking forward to the divorce being final and at the very least for L to move out so that I can slowly introduce S into the kids lives Also it will be great to have S over on nights that L has the kids Doing all that laundry was a big relief a real sense of accomplishment This Week s To Do List haircut dye culligan to fix water softener on Tuesday bike ride or movie or see S on Tuesday night house appraisal for re fi on Friday at 2 30p trim weeds mow lawn fix garage door garage trim laundry one more load to do SAP backups Monday through Thursday nights Yoga Thursday night Bike ride Saturday Hike with hiking class on Sunday at Devil s Den Half day Thursday for lunch shopping with S date with S Friday night 1 month anniversary date with S Satruday night Sunday night go to Norwich for training next week If I actually do half of this I ll be happy I also have to do a change to install a PCI parallel port card into a server and I have to cover 1 2 war room phone calls for some trojan going around that we re helping to investigate I volunteered for Monday night 10p 6a or Wednesday night 10p 6a 

23	Okay so today is the last day of 2003 It seemed to go by so quickly I think that all in all it was a pretty good year The past few weeks have been a little out there but in a good way I am so smart I have a perfect 4 0 GPA this semester now if only I could get money for that and I love that all of my grades are A for Annie I guess that all those hours spent NOT sleeping paid off Christmas was wonderful I actually got a talking Eeyore one who others can hear not just me hearing the voices in my head His brothers are so excited I LOVE that thing I even got a little bling bling from the boy who is being wonderfuller and wonderfuller even if he is too practical sometimes I think this Christmas was one of the best I ve had so far When I came to NYC and Queens for those of you who are keeping track I got a letter in the mail saying that I was invited on an educational expedition in AUSTRALIA It s some place called International Mission on Education and they select like 80 college students from the U S or so they say to go to Australia and check out all the cool stuff they do in the educational field there Totally a once in a lifetime opportunity but it costs way more than this future educator can afford If anyone knows if this company is legit please please let me know I wanna go so bad Unfortunately short of selling my soul on eBay or doing some other morally reprehensible act I m not sure if this trip is feasible I really can t think of many ways to raise 4000 in two months that don t involve run ins with the law Now that that s off my mind I can rest a little easier I just want 2004 to be an awesome year for me I secretly think it will be The new Harry Potter comes out in June how bad can it be oD Okay I will talk to you all next year I know that was corny but it had to be done Peace All and Happy New Year Don t get too drunk or at least don t puke yuck ttfn me

23	Today was an overall wonderful day minus the permanent fixture of stomach pains I actually got an 87 on my History mid term which is a great grade for me for History I thought for sure that I had bombed that one God works in mysterious ways In other news I am finding it harder and harder to type with these damn nails Next time they are getting cut way short I am going to have a freaking fit if I make another type because of these stupid things Oh well it s my own fault I suppose I will learn to get over it Sitting here wasting some time online checking out cool new Internet Explorer skins I am totally addicted to personalizing my computer It s my baby If anyone else gets this bored feel free to email me BabyFatChance hotmail com Okay Just wanted to check in before I hit the sack Time for bed minus the cute little bedtime buddy I left behind in NYC Miss you Eeyore 

23	Today has been one of the hardest days of my life I never thought it would be so difficult to deal with losing someone It seems like a person can be here one minute and then gone the next you never know when or where will be the last time you see them It could be at an all you can eat sushi restaurant where you share what you both have been up to for the past few years since high school It could be walking through the west village looking for a place that sells nose piercing retainers It could be in the Astor Place K Mart looking for a cheap Rangers t shirt The last time I saw Oscar was as he stepped off the W onto the Times Square platform to go home He gave me snacks to take for the long bus ride back to Boston He gave me inspiration in his courage He brought a smile to my face every time I talked to him Now he is gone He s not hurting anymore RIP Oscar Orlando Acosta Jr You are missed more than you know 

23	So much to talk about and yet so little Well I can start off by mentioning that school has once again resumed much to my chagrin I have never felt less like doing school work Why can t you just go to classes when you feel like it I would do so much more work if I actually felt interested in the course content Alas such is the life of a college student it is a hard path to hoe but I m doing the best I can In other news this Spring Break was not all for naught I went to the urlLink Foxy Lady in Brockton for those of you who don t know what that is use your imaginations or click on the link DUH on Saturday night It s amazing what you can see pierced there and I am somewhat inspired We can just leave it at that Again you may use your imaginations Just looking for a way to kill time between classes that is more interesting than doing actual assignments It s not easy being a world class slacker but someone s gotta do it I guess that nothing else of interest has happened lately besides my eventful trip on Saturday So I suppose that I will leave it at that ttfn me 

23	This little bundle of joy is courtesy of Rita who still finds a way to spread smiles through emails and share heartaches through phone calls That s what Bestest Friends are for This guy was lonely and so he decided life would be more fun if he had a pet So he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual pet After some discussion he finally bought a centipede which came in a little white box to use for his house He took the box back home found a good location for the box and decided he would start off by taking his new pet to the bar to have a drink So he asked the centipede in the box Would you like to go to Frank s with me and have a beer But there was no answer from his new pet This bothered him a bit but he waited a few minutes and then asked him again How about going to the bar and having a drink with me But again there was no answer from his new friend and pet So he waited a few minutes more thinking about the situation He decided to ask him one more time this time putting his face up against the centipede s house and shouting Hey in there Would you like to go to Frank s place and have a drink with me A little voice came out of the box I heard you the first time I m putting on my fucking shoes For all of you who know Rita and I it is so obvious right now why we are Best Friends 

23	My history test is over and done with We can just leave it at that Although I don t think I did exceptionally well it has never taken me the full exam time to complete a test before this one I am fairly certain that I at least passed In other news I began to unwind from this horrible week by going to tonight s Bruins and Rangers game It was as usual a lot of fun urlLink Gonchar scored his first goal as a Bruin and good old Joe got the other two red lights tonight The people watching was at its prime there are so many entertaining imbeciles there to pass the time and the nachos aren t terrible either Hockey seems to make me feel better Vinnie s proposal includes one hockey game a week to relieve stress If he finances this method of treatment I won t be too opposed I can begin collecting the souvenir cups you can never have too many Hopefully spring break will make me feel better I got approval to stay in my dorm for the week I figured the office of residence life and housing might as well approve something since I didn t get the RA position No big deal I can have more time to myself and less time detracted from my studies and other such ventures Spring break has commenced and I am once again free The man can t hold me down anymore Okay gotta go to bed work tomorrow morning at 8 Later me 

23	Well it s confirmed I am having a nervous breakdown I ve got a history midterm tomorrow morning which I am dreading I am incredibly stressed out but that s okay only 2 more days until Spring Break Wonderful Spring Break or another reason to mope because I have no money to do something fun or someone fun who is willing to spend time and money with me Life is so sucky right now Just when you think things can t get any crappier SURPRISE If I don t figure out what the cause of all of my stomach aches are even if it isn t good news I am seriously going to freak out I would rather know something bad than not know anything at all I can t say that I would be shocked if it was stress related Only a few more days until I can just take it easy I will be counting down the hours Maybe I ll even do something fun if I can scrounge up the cash to celebrate my successful completion of half of this semester Or I will just sleep that s equally as good at this point Well wish me luck on my history test Lord knows that I am incapable of doing well without luck and plenty of prayers me 

23	Pretty wasted GOD BLESS JUNIOR SENIOR TOAST me 

23	Well now I am a real Catholic I was officially confirmed on Saturday at the Easter Vigil Mass at the Emmanuel Chapel It was pretty awesome And as an added bonus I am absolved of ALL my sins which is a pretty good deal Just reflecting on the importance the Catholic faith has had on all of my life s journeys Went to a discussion tonight on the urlLink Voice of the Faithful and was moved by the recognition that the church hierarchy needs to change not the church community and that really resonated within me Just wanted to get that out there in the open me 

23	Oh my GOD I HATE MICE Not only do I detest these vermin with a passion but I am even more repulsed when they make my room their sanctuary I am so freaked out right now I don t even know what to do I know that they re here and they aren t even scared of me How is it that this stupid little creature is smarter than me so much so that it makes me afraid to live in my own room I don t know what to do Please God don t let them get to my shoes HELP 

23	I feel like a new Annie Since my little excursion to the Emergency Room last week I have decided to take my health a little more seriously I also decided to participate in the Self Challenge I began the challenge on Monday and have been doing pretty well so far The only temptation I keep having is for chocolate but I have some will power albeit not enough to say no to a fun size Reese s FastBreak mmmmm But it was tiny Other than that my diet consists of pretty much all vegan earthy crunchy hippie food Not so tasty but I feel much MUCH better and no stomach pains I m definitely feeling sore but in a good way Once this icky Boston weather clears up I am resuscitating my baby and we are going out for a ride For those of you who are confused right now you obviously don t understand the relationship I have with my bicycle The only TV I ve been watching is Cartoon Network I m only human other than that my DVD player is in overdrive with The Joy of Yoga Today I discovered FitTV great for motivation and put my sticky mat to work It has never felt so good to be so sore At least I know it s not from something lame like falling down a flight of stairs which has also been known to happen I feel like I am making really positive changes in my life and I also know that that sounds corny but it s true I love yoga and it feels awesome to get back into it If only I had a yoga partner But I m barking up the wrong tree on that one Well I guess that s enough of me raving about the joys of healthy living Don t get me wrong I love the bad stuff as much as the next person but I have to get back into shape so I can enjoy the bad stuff to its full capacity he he he I shall write more later Have a blessed day me

45	I would have to say sometimes divorce can be bad My parent s got a divorce when I was about 11 years old It was hard on my brother and I because we lived in Montana and my mom lived in Colorado and we wanted badly to live with her and we didn t want to live with my dad When he got us back to Montana he changed and became a mean person Before that he was nice Then he was never around for us just for supper time was the only time he had for us Now if you ask my 13 year old son he would say that when his dad and I divorced was the best day of his live He told me when I got back from getting my divorce he said to me It was about time that you left him My children have always supported me on my divorce The only thing that botters them is the fact that their dad only gives them the phone calls but he won t see them He told them before that if he has to pay child support then he will never see them He says he shouldn t have to pay to see them Some parent s don t think how bad they destroy kid s when they are not in their lives

45	I would say that when you do something well it gives you a great feeling With being a parent to two great kids if feels good when you hear them tell you they love you I feel good when I help in my daughter s class room and just seeing her big smile and her being proud that I m there to help She is so proud to have me be there with her and the kids enjoy me being there I feel good when my kid s friends come over and are happy to see me and tell me that I m one of the best parents they ever meet They have fun being themselves they laugh and do things over here that they can t do at home like have water fights in the house or outside and yes I did say inside There is one girl that loves being here She lost her mom two years ago to cancer and she told me that she loves me as if I was her mom and that she feels that she can talk to me and that makes me feel good A couple days before Mother s Day she asked me if she could get something for me on Mother s Day I didn t know what to say and I did say that yes There are no words how to descibe how proud that child felt She s grounded for quite awhile and she calls and tells me she misses me and that no one understands her at home like I do I m glad that I can make a difference in a teenager s life 

45	I would have to say were I go for my escape from reality is fishing on the lake with our boat I don t have to rush to get some where or have to run here and there for my kids or husband The fish don t bug you like the kids and husband The fish don t know our names so you don t hear mom or sweety I like the relaxation that you get when you go fishing It s nice to sit there and feel the breeze and the only sound you hear are the other people in the boats finding their spots to fish or the kids haveing fun on the tubes or water skiing I feel that nothing can bother me here and I can enjoy God s creation that man has not destroy for the society I feel relaxed and don t worry about anything just to out fish my husband and son and sometimes thats hard with my son We actually laugh more here too they like seeing me squirm when they ask for the worms and leeches 

45	I was about 16 years old when I went to live with my mom and step dad I never really had a Christmas when I lived with my dad and all he could afford was two presents each for my brother and me That year that I moved in with my mom I had the biggest Christmas ever It was so huge that when I wake up I honsety thought I woke up in a different home That Christmas tree was very much so pregnant that I went back to bed and went to sleep and thought this time I will wake up and this time I will be in the right house To my suprise I was in the right house that tree didn t change at all I was working at McDonald s at the time so I had some money to buy presents for my family that was great I love to shop for people I have no problems getting them things I think that is why Christmas is my favorite holiday because I can buy presents for people and I can make them happy I like Christmas now that I have kids it great to see their smile and excitment on Christmas morning 

45	It is very dark and I am alone in a bed in the middle of a room I can t see anything but the area right around my bed I am freezing cold and I don t have enough blankets to stay warm I notice that someone is coming towards the bed Then someone else and then another person I never can see their faces but they get close enough to steal my blankets from my bed Once they have taken them they begin to use them like they are a jumprope They turn them over and over again I am laying there freezing to death wondering why they took my blankets I can not stop shaking and shivering I am so cold It is so dark and I don t understand what is happening I watch them twirling my blankets All of a sudden I notice that my blankets have actually turned into a rope The people or whatever they are slowly fade into the dark back round as they continue to twirl the rope or what used to be my blankets I wake up because I am so cold This is a dream that I have had ever since I was a child It seems that when I am sick with a fever or not feeling well I will dream this dream I have gotten to the point that when I am not feeling well I sometimes worry about the dream Even though it is harmless I still wonder where it comes from 

45	Every family has imperfections On August 9 1982 our wonderful imperfection was born From the moment our son was born we knew that he was not the perfect baby We were told that he had downs syndrome He had many health problems that were of great concern No one knew what the prognosis for our son was Of course we were devastated The fear of the unknown was the worst Weeks later we were told that the tests for downs syndrome were negative What was wrong with our baby In between doctors visits and hospitalizations we started to realize that there was something very precious about our son We soon realized that life revolved around his schedule not ours That was good for everybody because we stopped scheduling things like we had been used to We learned to just take things as they came We took more time to sit and cuddle with our son s We had to sit and rock one so it gave us the time to also read or talk to our other son Our son had many health problems he cried a lot and so did we but he also taught us how to accept things for what they are Over the years we have learned to be patient accepting people He has taught our whole family how to always find something positive in any situation He has taught us that even though you may not be just like everyone else everyone still has their own special qualities You can do anything you put your mind to if you will only try It might not be to the same capacity as the next person but at least you have tried I now look at my other two children and wonder how would their lives have been different if Brad was not born with all of his medical problems and other disabilities I question whether they would have grown up to be such good people Brad has been a learning experience for all of us He is truly the most wonderful imperfection in our family 

45	The author Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver is giving a detailed description of what her life is like in a nursing home in the essay My World Now Throughout the essay she describes how she has lost her privacy independence and her freedom She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation Because one day is just like the next it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is She talks about the residents with Alzheimer s who are not aware of where they are I wonder if she insn t a little envious that they are not aware of their fate The author talks about the fact that even the employees don t stay long because it is not a desirable place to work She states This is not the best job to have They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot My heart goes out to the author Because people are living longer these days they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days They loose everything they have worked so hard for even their privacy They are so lonely I don t know what the answer is I only know that my heart breaks everytime I must go visit someone in the nursing home 

45	After reading I Want a Wife written by Judy Brady I got the distinct idea that the author was feeling taken advantage of by her husband Throughout the essay she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the woman or wife is expected to do for the family Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first This essay is so typical of families today There are certainly exceptions to this stereo typical relashionship between husband and wife but for the most part I am sure that a lot of wives can relate to what the author is talking about I liked the way the author ended the essay I think what she was saying was not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family but he expects more Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires I never thought about it but maybe I would like a wife also 

45	After reading Fighting Back written by Stanton L Wormley JR I wondered what I would have done if I had been in his position I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did The author was raised in a upper middle class black family which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start The author did not hold the resentment anger and frustration that many poor black people hold He did not have to fight for everything he had Because of his social class the author was not angry at all white men He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight He questioned his response to the fight wondering Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp Self defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author felt that fighting back was justified He felt that fighting back for the black man and other minority groups was a statement of individual potency and self determination The author understood that by not fighting back he had disgraced the entire black population In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harbored from disgracing his people years ago and also he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military He had experienced life other than the upper middle class life he was accustomed to I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight he felt a great sense of hollowness Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight he did not like that he had become like the others and learned to fight back What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems No matter what 

45	I find that I learn best from experience Often times as a child if I was told not to do something I had to do it just to see what would happen I had to experience it for myself Somehow just being told why I shouldn t do something was not enough for me I always had an unmanageable desire to stick my fingers in holes Little holes big holes it didn t matter One day all the neighborhood kids were playing tag in our yard I was hiding on the side of the house behind some bushes and as I sat there waiting to be found I saw a big pipe laying there I couldn t just leave it alone I had to see if my finger would fit into the end of that pipe Even though I had been told many times not to stick my fingers in holes I stuck my finger in the pipe When I tried to remove my finger from the pipe it would not budge I panicked thinking Oh no my mom is going to kill me for doing something like this again I had no choice but to come out from hiding and see if the neighborhood kids could help me out We tried everything we could think of From having a few kids grab on and pull to trying to grease my finger up with cooking oil so that it would slip out of the pipe Nothing worked I knew I was going to have to call my mom at work and give her the bad news I dragged the pipe up the stairs to our second floor apartment and made the dreaded phone call Somehow my mom was not surprised She told me to fill the sink up with water and put a bunch of ice cubes in it so that I could soak my finger hoping to reduce the swelling so the pipe would come off I told her Mom you don t understand The pipe is about 6 feet long She said she would be right there Before I knew it there was a police man at our door Little did I know he was a friend of my mothers I thought I was in bigger trouble than I had originally imagined He explained that my mother had called and asked him to see what he could do for me His only solution was to take a hack saw and cut the pipe shorter so it was more manageable Still the pipe would not come off After a trip to the fire department during which there were two fire calls and my finger left on hold in a vice to have the pipe cut off I still had not learned my lesson If I had only been able to just learn about things because someone said so Life would have been so much easier I would never have gotten my finger stuck in my Grandfathers hospital bed or the antique glass bottle that had been in our family for years Once I was visiting my grandfather in the hospital As I was standing by his bed I noticed a little round hole on the corner of the footboard I stood there playing with the cover that slid over it The other family members in the room warned me not to stick my finger in that hole I just had to do it I just had to see if it would fit Again I was stuck On the way home from visiting my grandfather in the hospital we stopped at a restaurant to eat dinner There was a long row of wooden posts that separated the dining area from the entrance of the restaurant I casually stood by the posts with my family waiting for a table I stood there and wondered I wonder if my head will fit between two of those posts I was warned by my mother not to even think about doing something so foolish because I was going to get stuck I just had to do it I just had to see if my head would fit between two of those posts I couldn t listen to someone who knew what they were talking about I had to try it out for myself There I was in the middle of a busy restaurant stuck between those two posts I was left there all alone to figure out how I was going to get myself out of this one My family looked on in amazement unable to understand how I could do something so dumb Learning from others would certainly have been easier but life certainly wouldn t have been as exciting I would never have gotten my name in the paper explaining the whole pipe incident and at the end of the article they wrote And JoAnne was free If I could only have learned by example Looking back on my obsession with sticking my fingers in holes that they didn t belong in I realize that maybe I could have learned by example and experience Maybe after getting my finger stuck in a hole once or twice which is certainly learning by experience I should have listened to the advice I got from others that told me Don t do it again After years of experience I have finally learned to suppress the urge not to stick my body parts into holes even though life isn t nearly as exciting 

45	Dirty shoes and socks drive me crazy I don t know why but they always have I don t remember it being a big deal when I was younger but it seems that when I had children dirty shoes and socks became important My children hide their tennis shoes because they know that I will throw them in the washer if they are dirty They tell me that dirty tennis shoes are the best but I have a hard time dealing with them Dirty flip flops they don t survive in our house In the washer they go When my children were little and they wore the little white baby Stride Rite shoes I would polish them every night before I went to bed I found some kind of satisfaction in seeing those little white shoes all ready for the next day Maybe my obsession came from the little white corrective shoes my son wore from the time he was about 3 months old I had no choice of colors when he was first fitted for his size double zero shoes so white was what we had to take His two little shoes were attached to a metal bar that the doctor would adjust when we would go for checkups I remember that when Grandpa would hold our son especially after working outside the dirt from his clothing would rub off on his little white shoes I never commented on it I just knew that I would clean them up at the end of the day Maybe it has something to do with the fact that when I was a little girl I had to wear braces and corrective shoes also I was born with clubbed feet and my parents were told that I might never walk normally I remember growing to despise those corrective shoes and braces All the other girls my age had cute little dress up shoes and mine were just icky brown corrective shoes I guess when I was a baby they were white but for some reason the only color available for my size was white or black Every time I had to go for a brace fitting and new shoes I would ask Is there any other color The answer was always the same I used to be almost relieved when I was told that I had to have more surgery because it meant that I would get to wear cool white casts that could be painted and decorated instead of those icky brown corrective shoes I remember when our son was born and we were told that he had clubbed feet all I could think about was those icky brown shoes I wore when I was little Fortunately corrective shoes have improved since I was born and there is some variety to choose from 

45	I enter the house thinking that a cup of coffee sure sounds good right now While I am trying to keep busy doing all the things I am suppose to do before our company gets here my wife is running around like a chicken with her head cut off It can t be that hard getting ready to have a little company There can t be that much to do Terry Did you scrub the toilets Kids are your rooms cleaned up I hear my name being called What now What ridiculous thing does she think needs to be done before our company arrives Like our company is going to look under the beds or something I hear her here she comes Terry did you clean up the garage Clean up the garage Are we entertaining in the garage Why on earth do I need to clean up the garage I am sure there will be no one going into my garage And besides I think it looks pretty darn good I cleaned it a month or so ago Besides how can a garage stay clean if you do any work in it The company should be here soon Do I dare ask if it s okay for me to take a shower I can t shower too early because she will think I don t have anything to do I can t shower too late because she will say I am just messing up the bathroom Like our company is going to be in our bathroom Here she comes again Whew There she goes Oh Oh Terry would you make sure the kids cleaned up their rooms Cleaned up their rooms they are just going to mess them up again why clean them up I think it s safe to head for the shower I better not forget to wipe it down when I m done You never know people may get the idea we actually use this bathroom I wonder if I dare make some coffee A good strong cup of coffee sounds good after all that work getting ready for our company Hmmmm where do I drink it Is it to soon to sit down on the couch There she goes again She s been getting ready all day What could possibly be left to get done The food must be done because I can smell it cooking Looks like the table is set I think it s safe to sit down and relax a bit before the company arrives Terry is that all you have to do is sit down and drink a cup of coffee The company s going to be here any minute Ding Dong Ding Dong Thank goodness they are here maybe now I can finally have that cup of coffee 

45	Dirt What a confusing word Dirt can be thought of as filth garbage something unwanted We can t live without dirt We live on it and a lot of the food we eat is grown in it There is no such thing as clean dirt We don t like it when it blows around but we worry about it when it blows away There is so much of it and yet we have to buy it What fun would children have without dirt It seems like the dirtier they get the more fun they are having The bigger the dirt pile the further their imaginations can go It doesn t take anything special to play in dirt A stick an old container or just your hands and feet We can t live with it and we can t live without it 

45	I just recently returned from college orientation with my youngest child I anticipated this as such a sad time but suprisingly it was not I was full of many emotions from proud amazed anxious and wishful but not sad I am so proud of my daughter and all of her accomplishments From her athletic accomplishments to her academic accomplishments She has experienced some difficult times along with the positive ones but she has learned to persevere She has remained a very humble person even though she has so much to be proud of Amazing is another word that comes to mind All of my children have amazed me with their unique personalities and qualities but somehow she is different She is so thoughtful and compassionate towards others and yet she is still able to meet her own personal needs emotionally She knows when she needs time for herself but manages to balance those needs with the needs of others I am anxious for my daughter because I worry sometimes that she is missing out on the fun things in life She worries about things that most people her age don t think about She worries about finances family obligations her siblings and her father and I I remind her often that it is my job to worry about those things not hers I am wishful when I think of my daughter She has the world by the tail and I wish that when I was her age I could have been so sure of myself so independent so goal oriented I wish that I had the passion she feels for life and everything in it at such a young age I will miss her terribly when she is away at college but she is ready to move on to bigger and better things and I can t wait to watch her fly 

45	Tall magestic pine trees swaying in the wind they tower over the forests above all other trees They remain dark green and solid year round They grow slowly but they remain strong During the winter months when everything else is dead and dormant the pine tree remains green and healthy looking They provide shelter for the forest creatures under their strong branches Summer brings their time for growth and even though their needles are sharp to the touch their new growth is so soft and smooth Their new needles are a pale green and vulnerable at first but soon they blend into the rest of the tree adding more strength and size Pine trees do not allow much growth underneath them They don t need any other growth to sustain them They stand strong and independently in the woods Just like the pinecones they create They remain strong and whole once they drop from the trees The smell I love the smell of pine trees There is nothing better than the smell of fresh cut pine It is a strong smell but a comforting smell 

45	The best lesson my mother ever taught me was to not judge people Throughout my childhood things were not easy I was raised by a single Mom who wanted nothing but the best for me but at times let her own needs and emotions overshadow being a parent As a child I remember my mother always being either really up or really down It seemed like there was no inbetween My mother worked two jobs to support us and wanted everything to be perfect for us I think that was maybe part of the problem Her idea of perfect and my idea of perfect were not the same What things looked like on the outside was very important to my mother and still is I was dressed well I lived in a good home in a good neighborhood and I went to good schools I know that there were times when my mother could not afford to dress me in the best clothes or send me to summer camps but she managed to do it anyway The sad part about it was that it meant she was working all that much more She was not at home with me In the evenings when I needed her for homework she was working When I needed her just to listen to what was on my mind she was working When I just needed a hug she was working I know now that this was probably her way of showing her love for me and that she was probably avoiding feeling lonely but it was not until I became an adult and had a family of my own that I realized it I can remember getting so angry because I was tired of taking care of my brother and sister all the time I would be in charge while my mom was away which seemed like all the time and then when she would get home everything was turned upside down I liked the house to be just so and my mom didn t care I cooked meals at certain times and my mom would sometime forget about meals Throughout those years I continued to make mental notes as to what I would and wouldn t do as a parent Of course being a parent is not as easy as I thought it was when I was a child I have been so fortunate I was able to stay at home with my children when they were young I have been able to be there for them in the evenings to help them with their homework and have supper cooked so that we can sit down as a family almost every evening I have been able to be there when my kids needed hug or just someone to talk to but most of all I have realized that I could not have done it without my husband of 25 years I cannot imagine raising a family as a single parent I now appreciate the sacrifices my mother made in order to provide us with what she thought we needed Maybe she just couldn t be there emotionally for us then but she did the best she could I have since gotten over my resentment and anger for having to be the mom at home when I was young but I realize now that what my mom did was make me a better parent for my children Thank you mom 

45	Euthanasia Euthanasia will be a world wide argument until there is no more disease pain or suffering in the world It will continue to be a very controversial subject The question of Euthanasia is based on our value system The way our values are arranged in individual personalities result in different beliefs and attitudes I personally think that one of the major contributors to the current problem with the moral issues of Euthanasia is due partly to the successes of medical science not its failures The increase in advanced medical technologies especially life sustaining ones has brought the more recent focus on the various moral issues involved in euthanasia When machines tubes and computers take over we sometimes loose sight of what is truly best for the patient and compassion along with common sense sometimes seem to suffer Fortunately there seems to be an increased awareness of the intrusiveness of modern technology Is keeping someone alive always the right thing to do I have a 21 year old son with many health problems some of them life threatening I have seen the pain and the suffering that my son has experienced I have felt the helplessness while sitting at his bedside unable to relieve his pain and suffering wondering how much more can he take or can we take At age eight our son and family were sent on a Make A Wish trip because he was not expected to live to be nine years old We as a family deal with our son s daily intravenous infusions lasting up to 11 hours central line dressing changes diabetes blood transfusions regular lab work and constant trips to the doctor Our son has undergone more than 30 operations including one in which part of his stomach was removed Along with numerous tumors being removed he has also undergone a pancreas transplant His transplant failed and he is presently on the waiting list with high hopes that his next transplant will be a success With the insurance company s limit of only two transplants if this next one fails we as a family have to come up with the 200 000 00 needed to pay for another transplant in hopes of prolonging our son s life He is also immune deficient meaning that he is always at risk of developing serious complications from only the simplest infections Of course we will do anything to keep our son with us but we know that because of his complicated life threatening health problems there may be a day when there is no more anyone can do I am ashamed to admit that there have been a few times when we as a parents have asked ourselves how much more we should put our child through but somehow we have known to keep trying I only hope that when and if the day comes when there are no other healthcare choices we have the option to make the decision that is best for our son and our family I believe that we along with our son should have the right to choose whether he has suffered enough My own personal experiences influence my feelings about euthanasia and its morality I strongly believe that individuals should be allowed the right to choose how and when our lives should end in the case of terminal or incurable illness 

45	I have always been envious of people who can put their feelings thoughts or opinions on paper and actually have it make sense To be able to make a point on paper and have others interpret your point as you want them to must be very fulfilling What I have noticed as a result of reading the many different essays from The Familiar Essay textbook is that there is no right or wrong thing to say or write It is how you say and write it and when you say it For example writing from a child s perspective is much more effective in the story Coon Hunt than it would have been had it been presented from an adults point of view The short direct sentences help us to understand the underlying message this author was trying to convey I was fascinated by the subtleness the author used to present the abuse she was being subjected to by her father I have become much more aware of the underlying messages that a writer can weave into their stories Often times this message can be missed if you are not actually looking for something Reading a story more than once can give you a whole new perspective on what the author is writing about I have found it very interesting when talking in class about stories that we have read how one person can read a story so differently than another When discussing the same story among class members I love to hear all the different interpretations of the exact same story 

45	The Big Fork River campground is a place that comes to mind The huge pine trees the ferocious river whooshing by There is the wonderful sound of water that that I have always found to be so soothing and comforting Every year we go camping to the Big Fork River campground It s a beautiful place just off the highway but you would never know it once you turn off the road and enter the campground There are enormous rocks that line the river banks towering over the wild water that rushes by There are campsites right on the river bank and I always hope that the one located on the point is available when we get there You can not make reservations at this camp site so you never know what might be available This spot is unbelievably beautiful From the tall pine trees that stand in contrast to the bright blue sky to the wild golden brown water that is constantly rushing by it is all such a splendid site Of course when we go there we always know that Grandpa will be there guiding us as we park as we unpack the campers as we get everything organized He often times would leave hours ahead of us just so we could get the spot that we all loved so much He would save it for us by parking there knowing how much we loved it It didn t matter to Grandpa that he didn t get the favorite spot It was more important to him to save it for us Once we got everything setup and Grandpa was satisfied that everything was okay we would go exploring We would walk along the rocky banks of the river looking for any treasures that might have washed up His main purpose for this walk was to find the best fishing hole so that we might have fish for supper He knew we loved that too Grandpa would make sure that he had the perfect marshmallow sticks cut for the after supper campfire that we all enjoyed so much While we sat around the campfire there was the whittling that needed to be done The kids loved to try and guess just what Grandpa was going to create out of some little stick or log and also who would be the lucky recipient of the finished product Somehow Grandpa always made sure that everyone had something he had whittled before the camping trip was over Morning was a time that could be a little frustrating with Grandpa He would be up at the crack of dawn chopping wood to get the campfire going again I would lay there and listen to him making sure that the fire was just right and then we would hear the dreaded bang bang bang on the camper door Time to get up the day s a wasting The kids would crawl out of their sleeping bags all sleepy eyed and head out the door to sit by the fire with Grandpa He always made sure that there was a dry place to sit They would talk about their plans for the day and of course pretend to criticize Granny and me for not hopping up right away to get breakfast going Grandpa would say Time to get moving the day is a wasting To Grandpa camping on the Big Fork River was all about the adventures and the experiences he shared with all of us About a year and half ago Grandpa passed away We have not returned to the Big Fork River Somehow it could never be the same without Grandpa there We have talked as a family that we must return and carry on even though Grandpa is not there because remember Time to get moving the day is a wasting 

45	Have you ever really thought about how much time you spend worrying I worry about my children my husband the house and my work I worry about school my parents my sister and her children When I don t have some one to worry about I seem to find some thing to worry about Are the kids safe Did my husband eat lunch Did I remember to turn the iron off before I rushed out of the house Did I remember to get all of my homework done Is my sister doing okay after her husbands death How are her children doing I rarely think about the time I spend worrying about all of these things but every once in awhile I get a little selfish I have to wonder when is the last time I worried about me I then realize that it has been a very long time since I have given much thought to myself I used to enjoy reading cross stitching walking and even just sitting quietly all by myself every now and then I can t remember the last time I have had the time to do any of those things What would I do with time to myself and nothing to worry about If I could imagine a perfect afternoon all to myself it would have to be laying on our porch swing on a sunny afternoon The birds are singing the wind is blowing just enough to make the leaves rustle The sun is shining on the back of the porch swing just enough to keep it comfortably warm I am getting sleepy as the swing moves back and forth I have been reading a wonderful book for too long and my eyes have grown tired I close my eyes As I lay there quietly taking in all of the sounds and smells of the beatuiful afternoon I doze off I sleep so soundly not worrying about anything No telephones ringing no schedules to follow no meals to be cooked and no laundry to be done I sleep for hours I don t dream I am not worrying As I slowly awake I realize that the warm sun has begun to disapear from the sky because the warmth on the back of the swing is no longer there What a wonderful afternoon nap I have had The birds are still singing and the leaves are still rustling and all of a sudden I here a screen door slam and then I here Mom where are you I m home 

45	Can I do it Will I be able to keep up to it s demands Will I be able to finish Am I being selfish These are the questions that I asked my self over and over and over again when I decided to go back to school I would ride through the BSU campus looking at all the people walking from one class to another wondering how many of them were my age or older How were they doing it Was it a possible task Was I to old to be thinking about returning to school These are questions that still plague me from time to time but I have discovered I can do it It is possible I am doing it Somehow I am managing to go to school full time take care of my family work part time and still remain a sane human being I will be the first to admit that I could not have done it without my family They have been so supportive and encouraging At times when the load seemed to heavy they would step up to the plate and do whatever needed to be done to make things easier for me Granted everyone is probably getting a little tired of Dad s creative cooking and his uncanny ability to get one red sock in with the white clothes every time he does laundry but at least he tries I have a new appreciation for students especially single parents that are trying to burn the candle at both ends Give yourselves a huge pat on the back You deserve it 

45	Write about something people neglect without meaning to From my experience of when I was married for ten years I find the one thing that people neglect without meaning to is to give each other compliments I feel that after being together for ten years we started to take each other for granted Before the divorce we tryed counseling and the one thing I found that was actually helping and working was writing down the positive things about each other and we continued doing this for five weeks and then that counselor moved to the cities and our marriage ended shortly after that We didn t continue to do what he had planned for us that what actually was working Taking each other for granted is very easy to do so I feel it s very worthwhile to put in the time and find out each others interests This is not the only thing that went wrong in my marriage My ex husband was never one to communicate He was like living with a ghost Either that or I just talked too much for the both of us Sometimes I would tell him that But seriously there are things I needed to compliment or thank him for and I didn t Such as for example changing the oil on my car so I wouldn t need to drive sixteen miles to town to have it done or taking the time off work to come to my job and change my flat tire I was wearing white jeans that day so I did very much appreciate it but being he was my husband at the time I just figured this is what he s supposed to do so this is what I mean by taking someone for granted This was in our ninth year of marriage Of course this works both ways We both worked at Marvin Windows in Warroad Minnesota for the big window company I worked there for four years and to this day he is still there In the four years we worked there I would pack out lunches and help get our two girls to daycare and for me a thank you would have been nice just as it would have been for him I know I packed good lunches because one guy at his table would tell him he would want his lunch box instead of his own So this is why I feel people take each other for granted and neglect each other without meaning to I also feel it has just been crazy with the hustle and bustle of life but what would it hurt to just take these few extra moments after work to talk and just say Hey I really appreciate all you do for me Thanks for sticking by my side One of the other things I noticed is that I would always make chocolate chip cookies and within a week they were gone This part is making me hungry He would just ask if I made a new batch of chocolate chip cookies and I d start in by making more and that one of the things of neglect No comments on how good they were but where s more instead I feel I neglect listening to my daughter without meaning to She always catches me when I am busy with the dishes or doing laundry or getting after my three year old and I do try to explain when I tuck her in at night she can tell me then and I ll have her write it down what she wanted to talk about and then I think Man what would it hurt to leave the dishes soak and listen to what she has to tell me so sometimes I will do that but once I give her an inch she takes a mile She has been helping me so much with my three year old that I have thanked her time and time again and what an angel she has been and then she gets this big smile and just grins from ear to ear So one thing people neglect without meaning to is each other sometimes This is important to me because my two girls Bridget and Brittany are my life and also my three year old son Riley It is very hard being a single mom but in the end it is all worth it 

45	I have five brothers and three sisters We all have been in a car accident We also are hard workers and have tempers every one of us Some of us control our temper and some of us do not We all agree about our one brother being dropped on his head or something because he is definitely the class clown and is loud and obnoxious

45	Hi This is me Bonnie Welcome to my individual blog entry 

45	Today turned out to be a good day for me I enjoyed getting something accomplished Yesterday started out with my son Riley and his grandpa calling to see if we d like to come over to pick peas from his garden Brittany my daughter agreed to come with and help so on our way we went to Granpa Everetts to pick peas Meanwhile a van pulled up in the yard and this was Everett s son Dale and his three girls Heidi Holly and Ellie Mae There Mom went to a reunion for the weekend We enjoyed visiting and then Martha the grandma got off work and was home Everett decided to take us all to Lengby Minnesota for supper They served walleye chicken strips and chicken drummies with a salad The kids were pretty good and there was music Ellie Mae started dancing She is two years old and they re so cute at that age Shortly after eating we went to Everetts where my daughter Brittany wanted to spend the night Riley and I went back to our house Today we slept in some and took a bath and he couldn t wait to get back to grandpa s house to play with the girls They live in Wahpeton so he doesn t get to see them often Heidi is six years old and Holly is four years old Ellie Mae as I mentioned earlier turned two years old in May Riley also turned three years old in May and my daughter Brittany is eleven years old While we were out there I worked on essays I had for class to finish up Grandpa made Brats on the grill and they were really good He and Martha went to visit friends who were up here from texas so we decided to go fishing out on the pontoon at pine lake The kids were all excited Earlier they were playing with kittens out on the farm and forgot all about them when pine lake and fishing were mentioned Dean and Dale went to get gas for the pontoon I applied sunscreen to all the kids while waiting for them to return They bought drinks for the kids and us also We had three fishing lines going and Heidi caught a sixteen inch walleye that weighed a little over two pounds We had lots of fun My daughter enjoyed herself and even got the chance to drive the boat So did one of Dale s girls Holly the four year old It turned out to be a beautiful day out on the lake with a fresh breeze just enough blow to hit for the cooling one needed from the sun beating down on us It felt good It was nice and relaxing The kids behaved well for five of them on the pontoon Roger owned the pontoon and helped get minnows on the hooks for the kids There also was another couple along and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves Riley caught a fish that got away before we got it in the pontoon Heidi the six year old caught a northern that got away also Scott another guy caught a fish that he threw back because he didn t feel like cleaning fish Dale caught a ting northern just a baby one that he threw back so the only one who caught something to keep was Heidi She was very proud but unhappy when roger filleted her fish because she wanted her mom to see it Good thing I had a camera in my purse since this is the first fish she has caught and has proof to show her fish to her mother We went to the lodge to see if grandpa and grandma were there and they were Riley was getting tired and spilled M M s on the floor so I decided to go home with him He fell asleep about eight thirty He looked pretty tired I decided to get my ceiling in the livingroom painted I just had white ceiling paint It still looks like it will need another coat Since I was painting I decided to do the walls in Dover White They also need another coat of paint but at least now the walls are all the same color What a job it can be I m not one for painting so I ll be glad when it is done I feel there is a lot I accomplished today It is now after midnight and I hope to get a good nights sleep in I did relax with pop and popcorn for a few minutes when I wrapped up the painting stuff like the brushes and putting the lids back on the paint so I can start again tomorrow Brittany stayed the night again at Everetts with the girls so when I get up I ll go pick her up or call and see what time Dale is going back to Wahpeton I just love good days like this with a memory created for the girls in the fun they had and my son Riley He was plumb tuckered out from a fun filled day I hope there s more to come of days like this The perfect day is what I d call it 

45	My dad now eighty three years old talks of the price of gasoline and how dramatically things have changed from his time How different in the world today now It s gone up again It is on average at one dollar and eighty eight cents This is just ridiculous when the price of gasoline went up to over two dollars a gallon How outrageous is that I remember driving by wal mart and telling my oldest daughter At these prices Mom is going to have to quit school It was just getting to be too high of a price I live forty five miles away and round trip it takes a lot of gas not to mention the wear of the tires My three year old was on the riding lawnmower with me last week and I ran out of gas We went to fill the gas can so I decided to fill my car too It was over thirty dollars I couldn t believe it When I got home I told him to play on his swingset in the playpen until I get the grass mowed around the trees He is three years old and mischievious I filled the pushmower up with gas and left the gas can sitting within his reach I had the inside of the fence to mow and he spotted this bright red can and starting dumping the gasoline on the ground He s lucky I didn t tan his behind I stripped his clothes washed them two times in the washer and gave him a bath He had gotten gasoline all over his pants He had spiderman pajamas on that he refused to take off and wanted to wear them for the day After getting gasoline all over and on the ground he had no choice but to go in the tub and get different clothes to wear 

45	The crack in my windshield bothers me because I don t know how it happened Isn t that glass to be made strong enough Sometimes a rock chip when meeting a car or behind a truck flying at the window leaves an impression I wonder what glass in made out of I would think they would make a windshield strong enough to withhold a rock chipping the window but I suppose going down the road and this rock is flying up at sixty miles an hour it s just lucky the whole window didn t shatter I still can t figure out this one break in my window It is on the passenger side and is spreading out like a spider The only thing I can think of is a baseball hitting it There was an auction and I noticed it after the sale Now the one crack in the windshield is cutting across getting close to the driver side I have had people tell me that it looks like a break from the inside or the sun can do that to a window I had to laugh How cn the sun have done it when I had my car parked in the shade The day was very hot I guess to find out I will never really know what happened just that I need to get it fixed It is still on the passenger side slowing innching its way to the driver side right where it is eyesight level The crack coming across is by the mirror now and I m hoping it will bend downward instead of hit at eye level I don t want to get stopped for this cracked window Someone told me once that the state trooper will do that I would think it would need to be pretty bad for that to happen and with most of this in the upper right hand corner of the passenger side I would think this isn t as serious as other car windows that I have witnessed in parking lots or the grocery story lot Some cars don t even have a window Other cars put up cardboard Some cars use cheap plastic and some cars don t cover the window at all I m happy with the car I have now I find myself grateful for the one I have when I see others driving cars worse than my own 

45	Volleyball is a sport that I loved to play in high school I wasn t the best player or the worse I enjoyed every year that I played I joined seventh through twelvth grade I tryed other sports but this was my favorite and the one I enjoyed One time I remember being the only one with a perfect serving record My couch showed me the stats when were playing Adults against the eighth grade team This sport is to be taken seriously with a couch or another way to see it is just to have fun out on the beach with friends in the warm sun So this sport is an either or situation To have fun with it or to take it seriously Whichever one to pick or choose it is always a fun sport to me 

45	It s christmas and i m excited today because mom dad and my sister are going to get the christmas tree today I get to ride in the sled hooked to the snowmobile There is a saw and I get to help cut down our christmas tree We drive around and mom and i are in back Dad dumps us out in the snow We are laughing and having fun My sister is helping my dad drive We spot the tree we want for christmas My dad starts to cut it down This is at the ESPE Tree Farm in Wannaska We live twelve miles from there We now head back to the cabin to pay for our tree Mrs Espe invites us in for her hot chocolate and homemade cookies We enjoy them and I ask to take some cookies home There are other people to visit with We load our tree and head home Dad finishes trimming the tree while mom finds the stand for the tree My sister and I help mom find the decorations We are all tired but too excited so dad brings in the tree and we string the lights on first We continue to decorate and I want to string popcorn I don t finish stringing the popcorn that night Mom is helping me Even though we finish with the decorations being put on the tree my mom helps me the next day to get the popcorn string done and we somehow manage to make it look nice and add it to our We went to my Sunday School program and when we got home we took turns taking pictures in front of the tree I wonder which presents are mine Every year we take turns putting the angel on top of the tree My mom told me once she watches over us while we sleep We have our own special day for opening presents before we go to granpa and grandma s house One year I asked santa for a furby but I didn t get one I was disappointed but mom said that santa had too many kids asking for the same thing and his elves couldn t keep up Later in april for my birthday I got my furby I had lots of fun and then I ended up with another one from a friend who had given one to me It was fun to teach them how to talk One was the color blue and the other was light blue Now I ve outgrown them and gave them to my sister 

45	Ever since I was three years old I remember complaining of the back of my knees always hurting My mom told me I d run too much so I was to take it easy She would rub the back of my knees until I would fall asleep and the minute she would quit rubbing I would wake up immediately Later on during my teenage years I ended up in the hospital with pnemonia for a week and lost forty pounds After that I kept having health problems I ended up in the hospital again for a blood transfusion I had to have three pints of blood that my brothers had to donate back because my mom and dad were too poor to pay for the bill I ended up in the emergency many times for sprained ankles and wrists The doctors never could figure it out until 1986 when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritus That was in fosston minnesota Dr Havens was the doctor at that time He sent me to Dr Lessard a rheaumatologist in Grand Forks N D He had a bad bedside manner I went to him for five years One time he told me to drink a beer at night to loosen up I was upset because my health was going to hell in a handbasket I took my health for granted started to feel sorry for myself and getting depressed on top of it When I married I had a little girl and I was overwhelmed with being a new mom I had postpartum depression that I was not diagnosed for but I would cry over little things The way she smiled the way she cryed etc When in Warroad I worked at Marvin Windows and was pregnant with my second child In the fourth month I was sick from here on out with the pregnancy She was born five weeks early and in the NICU in Grand Forks hospital for thirteen days She was five pounds seven and a quarter ounces The doctors were stumped of her early delivery and I was scared myself I started to have blackouts and had trouble walking I stayed home four months and then returned to work I brought in an American with Disibilities handbook and within minutes I had a sitdown job I put up with a lot of sny remarks It was aweful I tryed other jobs and still was sick I kept getting sick and slipping deeper and deeper into depression Finally to the doctor again This was in warroad mn and was diagnosed with Lupus I was sent to the Mayo Clinc and there were various tests where I was diagnosed with a blood clotting disease a thyroid problem and lupus I was put on medication and feeling much better Then the depression hit me hard I had a terrible job my marriage was terrible and I ended up in the hospital for medication that worked against me I became suicidal and was taken off of the drug I got better eventually I have been stressed and burdened with health problems tremendously And now I still have problems but do the best I can to cope with what is a lifelong experience that won t go away 

45	I would love to fix my house but have little money to do this on The basement is one thing I really would like to get done but I don t see that happenind for a while I decided to concentrate on my living room so thursday I went to Menards in Grand Forks to price out everything I need I was having fun It s going to cost me about two hundred dollars to get my living room done The walls I am going to do in dover white I m going to get blinds that are an ivory color and these neat looking rods to have a tan sway above the blinds I m going with a shade darker for the trim and when I finish this class this is what I hope to work on during my two weeks off before school starts up again I m excited because my walls are blue and one is brown I was experimenting I can t wait to see the change I have a light green on my trim and this is a hideous combination I am going to take before and after pictures and I can t wait I also need to get the ceiling painted When I was at school the girls busted the blind on the one window by playing ball in the house Anyway I can t wait until I get it done 

45	I dated my high school sweetheart and we were married ten years We divorced in 1999 He is now remarried and I remain single I became depressed and isolated myself from everyone I stayed home In January this year I somehow got started in school and my self esteem has increased It s been hard because I am a single mom and tire easily because I also have Lupus an immune disease At present this is in remission I only planned on school and taking care of my kids I had no interest in finding someone in my life This didn t happen I was helping my friend get ready for an aution sale and she had company stop in He wanted me to meet this guy I wouldn t agree to the blind date deal but I would meet him if he were to come with I had a bad experience on a blind date and this turned me from ever going on another one This guy seems really nice but is not divorced He had been separated nine months and I think today is actually when the divorce is final I ve been seeing him for about a month now For the first week he called me everyday and was also over everyday I found it hard to get my school work done because he would stay until 11 00 p m or later and then go home One time he called and asked about us and I told him the truth I really have been getting mixed messages and don t have time for anyone in my life right now I got a bad feeling and within minutes he was over Thank goodness I was at my friends He stayed for three and a half hours He did take the kids to the park but my friend told me not to leave so I didn t I thought it was over He called leaving a message to call him back I didn t Friday the last day of speech my friend rode back to clearbrook with me She lives in Bemidji but her parents live in clearbrook She is one who smokes and it was late There was no place to stop but the Leonard bar and this guy was waiting for me Before she got out of the car he came out and gave me the dirtiest look She went in for her cigarettes and he came over He told me how rude I was on Wednesday I thought it was rude of him to come over and I let him know it He told me it would work and of course talked me into going to the Besida Bar and Grill for supper and talk things over We never did talk much but had prime rib which was delicious We went to Sportsmans Lodge after and danced On the way there he talked of his drunken soon to be ex wife I hear of her everyday and finally told him if I got to listen to one more word i m going to get mad I did I let him have it and told him of my divorce He said See you do the same thing Oh if nothing made me more mad that did and to top it off he told me to get over it This really pissed me off because I have been divorced five years joined a support group for divorced widowed and separated and felt much better and I am glad to be over mine There was another incident soon after that I would say was about a week ago He told me I had problems and worded it just right to piss me off again I told him to stay out of my life and I didn t need this Just stay away from me and leave me alone It didn t work The waterpump went out on his pick up and today I am going to try work up my nerve to end it again I went out saturday night I am not a drinker but I m glad I was drinking and by myself that night I had a lot of fun and stayed at a cabin so I didn t drink and drive I think I was drinking just to get all the worries off my mind and this doesn t make me proud to drink I just don t like it but that night something got into me and I drand windsor cokes I had four More than enough for me because I am a non drinker It hit me hard This guy just wants to be friends but gives me mixed signals and turns this around on me saying I am doing this to him I see his good points in how he is a good worker keeps his house clean and takes care of his kids His bad point is he wants to see me all the time Last time he said I should just put school off I told him not a chance Anyway I how I get this worked out soon before I get sick and my Lupus flares up 

45	I chose this topic because I have a sister who is in deep trouble because of meth This started a while ago when she met this guy selling and dealing meth This is what got her started She dated him for two to three years It seemed longer to me because personally I didn t like him from the start He started keeping and turning her against family like we were the ones who weren t helping her He tell her we were no good and she should stay away from us which she did She paid 8000 00 dollars for a trailer house and within a six month frame period she had borrowed money from the bank and had nothing left to show for herself She got away from him by moving to Grand Forks and met another guy not much better than the first How can she keep meeting this men who are no good for her He smoked marijuana and has been in jail and on probation numerous times She has an eleven year old daughter from her first and only marriage With the guy in grand forks she has a daughter and son which are a year apart in age My niece will be two years old in septemper and my nephew will be one year in september One was born the 22nd of sept and the other the 16th There has been so much confusion and sadness I don t know myself how to deal with it all because there is nothing I can do Last year when my nephew was born he tested positive for having meth in his system My sister called me frightened and scared I went down to Grand Forks where he was in the NICU There wasn t much I could do Social Services placed him in Foster Care That is how it works when they are born in the hospital and family has no say We did about my niece My sister in the cities had come up to take her to her home for a while and then my brother had her for a while My sister went to treatment last year and in December she came to my house She looked better and felt better than she had in a long time I have a lot of ambivalance toward my sister and I did try to help It took a while but when I started school she had gotten back her kids and stayed with me in January 2004 for a month My mom lived four miles from me so I told her with my going to school it was too hard for me I have a small house and my mom has an extra room so I asked her to go there She threw a fit and told me I was throwing her to the curb when she needed me most I know I didn t because she had my mom s place to stay As I m writing this I found out yesterday that she had a bad U A I was shocked because she had been doing so well My other sister who is thirteen months older than I visited her regularly She had been on house arrest for three months and would of had it taken off yesterday My brother and Mom went to get my niece because he is taking her so social services doesn t place her in fostercare My nephew is going to foster care to the same people who had him before They are the most wonderful people and have been there trying to help my sister and her kids My niece who is eleven years old is staying with her aunt because her dad is working construction in the cities He comes home every week end to see her This is the same arrangement that was set up before When she got into trouble before it was in the paper and of course people talk My sister puts the blame on me for everyone finding out and this time I don t care I m so mad that I want to slap her and hug her at the same time I feel torn I feel hurt I hated that I had to tell my two daughters about this They both love their aunt dearly and I just don t know what to do anymore I let my oldest daughter who is fourteen years old stay there for one week to help out with the kids not realizing the dangerous environment I had placed her in I wasn t thinking of that I thought to help keep my sister off of drugs known as crank it would help to have her babysit the kids Now I will not allow her to go there Only if we visit and then leave My sister isn t willing to give up on the guy she is with who is still in jail but will be getting out on probation shortly What a messed up life for her What I want to do is try to forget about all this and concentrate on my going to school and taking care of my own kids This is difficult to do because in order to work out problems such as this one I go to a counselor myself There is no way I can deal with this on my own My family gets mad at me because they don t want anyone to know They are in denial and with it being in the newspaper I don t know how they figure this isn t going to get out I cryed when I heard of this happening all over again I hear people say that meth is the worse addictive behavior to have and it is hard to get off of and stay away from it I guess she thinks more of her addiction than she does the life of her own kids I don t know what is going to happen but this time I would think she gets jailtime I don t even want to have anything to do with her anymore I love and hate her at the same time but she was given a chance and I can t see how she could be so dumb to screw it up again You d think she d of learned from the first time of losing her kids This time may be permanent placement and to tell you the truth it would be for the best 

45	There isn t a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning when the sun is shining he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was I thought it to be quite ugly myself And that was the name of it The Ugly Tomato He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don t taste much different He plants way too many tomato plants He had people from all over town in gonvick minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty Gonvick is a small town The population is around three hundred My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain My daughter Brittany doesn t care for tomatoes much Bridget my oldest daughter does though She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find She also loves the cherry tomatoes I m not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B L T 

45	Someday I hope to have a house bigger than what i am living in now and have enough money to do what i want instead of just live paycheck to paycheck It gets old In this neck of the woods I wonder how many of us there are I think there are only a few people with money in this area and I wish I were one of them Someday I hope to take a trip myself This won t happen for a while because my youngest is three years old and i want to enjoy myself with hopefully someone special in my life by that time Someday I hope to go to Hawaii Someday could go on forever but I hope someday I will also win the lottery or go to the black hills That may be a goal i could start now Someday I would like to go on an airplane or the amtrak to montana where my niece lives Someday I hope they find a cure for cancer and other illnesses Sooner than later Someday 

45	I still see myself jumping around a bit but i find myself putting more thought into what i am writing about and i see it improving a little bit at a time I may not write the best but i do the best i can I enjoy reading the storys and trying to write on the subject afterwards It s fun to see what i come up with and i think by the end of class i will be doing a lot better I am having fun and i do think it also is helping improve my own self esteem I feel more confident than i did in the beginning 

45	I found this a tough subject To find something meaningless When mentioning the paper clip in class i thought that it helps hold papers together so that isn t meaningless to me Then I thought of tape but realized that helps with wrapping presents so the thing i find meaningless is butter or margarine I just don t see the difference I can take it or leave All i ever had was margarine and I was fine with that My sister in law grew up on butter but my brother says the same thing i do Margarine is cheaper and to my brother and i there really isn t much difference to us Reminds me of when i make chocolate chip cookies I use two sticks of margarine and the thought never occurred to me to use butter When i make chocolate chips bars i use margarine In fact i only buy butter when it is cheap enough It has to be on sale for me I don t know what the point of this meaningless subject is and i can t find an end The only time I have used butter is if i have bought it on sale and use when i make mashed potatoes but it makes no difference to me because it tastes the same to me even if i use margarine and i don t even think my sister in law can tell the difference then Especially if gravy is poured over the top of the mashed potatoes when eating them How would anyone know which one i used butter or margarine I guess the point I see myself coming to is Buy margarine It s Cheaper 

45	I think we have all improved in this class with our writing At first I think it was hard for all of us and this class to me requires more of a thinking process so I have seen all of us improve on that I like that we share our opinions because it is amazing to me of how we can read the same essay and still see things different I find the sharing helps me to see another angle or focus that i hadn t before I like this class but i feel pressed for time I m glad I have only this one left for the summer 

45	I enjoyed going to the park a lot It was my place of escape for some peace and quiet and I enjoyed the culvert and the river I remember there was a tree that had fallen across that river and I would walk and sit there for a long time I feel like there was a spot just for me because on that tree that fell across that river it had another part of a tree branching upward This is what I considered to be my private spot and this tree had a built in chair for me so it seemed That is how I pictured it I went there everyday during the summer The grass was so green There were also outhouses so I wouldn t need to go home to use the bathroom There were trees with names carved into them One had the shape of a heart with someones initials abbreviated inside that heart There were picnic tables Those also had abbreviations or initials in them as well We would have our last day of Sunday School at this park in Gonvick Minnesota We would have teachers bring bars or we would pack a lunch if we liked We played games and I remember someone falling into the river I don t remember exactly who it was but he she was completely drenched from his head to his her toes I went there to the park for Sunday School and Vacation Bible School Settings Sometimes as the child and sometimes as the Teacher I think I taught Sunday School for three years and I also helped with Vacation Bible School for two years We played games and ate lots of food I think this place I found to be safe for me in my life and I also have a lot of enjoyable memories I remember going there also with my brother and sister We would be running through the culvert because at times there wasn t much water so we would start running and swaying and moving from side to side so we wouldn t get wet by the water We would just keep having fun going back and forth from one end of the culvert to the other We weren t the only ones who did this because I remember the graffiti inside that culvert My brother Dennis would go fishing there during the summer and we d tag along my sister Jane and I I spent a great deal of summer with a friend Her name was Sherry We would also go there a lot and sometimes we would fall in I remember one time the water was going pretty rapidly and I didn t think nothing of it at the time but we could have drowned Boy I don t know if my Mom knows about that to this day I think the existance for this essay is that I found this place comfortable and convenient for me I would go down there and sometimes walk along the river to see where it led to I was gone for a long time It took me about two hours just to walk the one way of the river because I would find or spot some interesting things I thought of having a place where I would build a fort but that never happened I only imagined it It s sad to say but I think this was a hiding spot for me away from my dad when he was drinking I d get tired of the arguing and fighting so this is where I would always go for hours I also believe Sunday School is another Safe Haven place I found to be and I enjoyed the songs Sometimes I would sit on that tree and remember a song from church and sing One of those songs that I remember is What a Friend we Have in Jesus I also feel this was something I d like to say was my thinking grounds I found peace and serenity in these surroundings 

45	I think I have more than one imperfection in my family but one thing while growing up is I remember my Dad being gone a lot and found out that he is an Alcoholic I grew up with five brothers and three sisters and some are alcoholics and some are not I may not have turned into an alcoholic but I do remember how tough it was for all of us There were a lot of sleepless nights and I remember being very tired for school some days because my dad would come home drunk and wake us all up and finally he d either pass out or start eating something and then go to bed I had a hard time accepting and not understanding much about alcoholism until I went too some Al Anon meetings and it made me understand to detach from the alcohol and not the alcoholic Words just can t describe how many bottles of whiskey I dumped down the drain and my brothers and sisters did the same thing That wasn t the end of it though Something worse had to happen before my dad went to seek treatment and that was the part of molesting my niece This I have only been able to comprehend in the last couple years because I was a Senior when this happened When you think things can t get any worse than the drinking it can Thank goodness it was fondling and no intercourse That sounds bad but I m thankful for that part of it not getting any further than it already had My Dad is now a recovering alcoholic but still I find it hard to me to this day to see him and not picture what has been done I know it wasn t me and nothing did happen to me As for the rest of my family members I can not say for sure It is another sick disease My dad is now eighty three years old and I m not sure why I am writing of this now but I still love my Dad and Mom even though what has happened is wrong I remember my niece saying at the time that she didn t want to get grandpa in any trouble but I guess this is what it took for the drinking to stop He had a hard time because he was away in treatment for three and a half years and I wrote him back a letter when I received one from him It still really hurts when something like this happens and I think I speak for my dad my family and myself when I say we still always will suffer great emotional pain from this I feel this imperfection helped my dad to seek the help he needed The one thing I hate about all of this is why didn t he get help before it had come to that I guess I ll never know This was very hard for me to write about because in some ways I feel ashamed to be a part in this as family All I know is I never left my girls alone with my Dad even though I love him He may have this imperfection and his faults but he has taught me a lot also and in the last couple years I ve actually been able to talk and enjoy being around my dad where as before I would feel somewhat uncomfortable but not anymore 

45	Bonnie Erlandson College Writing I July 3 2004 In the story ONE HOUR the author catches my attention by starting out the day being so beautiful and then as I read further on I see it changing into something else That they are on their way to the hospital to pay their last respects to their wonderful father and grandfather This catches me off guard for a moment until I continue to read further on I think it s because of the way it just starts out being the nice day and I find it hard to believe when someone you know is sick but with his suffering the peace finally comes to an end for his family and himself when he passes away knowing his loved ones were there by his side to comfort him I think the author while talking about his grandfather and what I also see is the sense of humor being used the way is grandfather always smiled and never letting his family know his pain the talking of childhood memories brings me back to the little time I spent with my grandfather because he passed away when I was young His birthday was March 10th and what a coincidence so is mine I remember both my grandma and grandpa often especially while reading this story ONE HOUR This story takes me back to the day my Grandpa passed away and my dad wouldn t let me go to the funeral I remember him chewing snooze and spitting it into a folgers coffee can holding me on his lap and the lump he had on the one side of his face by his chin because it was obvious for anyone to see I also remember my grandmother being put in the home shortly after my grandpa died It wasn t long before she passed away and I remember getting to go to her funeral and I ll never forget how beautiful she looked I can still picture her to this day and she looked like an angel and that is exactly how I remember her She was a very caring person This is the grandparents on my dad s side and I wasn t born yet when my mom s parents passed away so I only go by storys that I hear from my mom or her sister or brother Mostly I just remember my Dad s parents though It doesn t seem like the memories ever fade Only that the time gets longer that they ve been gone I loved them both very much 

45	I make great homemade apple pies This is what I am told by my family anyway and it does feel really good to do something I enjoy and this makes me feel wonderful and helps me forget all my worries because I get into making my own homemade crust and peeling the applies and making a little apple out of the crust to put on top when I m ready to pop them in the oven and the smell is just peachy The aroma that fills the air just gives the good feeling that I ve accomplished something When they are done the apple pies disappear in a hurry I usually use six to seven red delicious apples in each pie and I always make at least two They are also my Dad s favorite His Birthday is May 31st and I had made apple pies the day before his birthday That morning he had told my mom that he wanted apple pie instead of cake for his birthday His wish came true when I came walking in the door with an apple pie in my hand I also remember that for thanksgiving my one brother had to stay home because his kids had the chickenpox so I brought him over apple pie I stayed only long enough to tell him Happy Thanksgiving and also long enough for him to tell me thank you and it is the closest to Grandma s pies that will ever be that good Now everyone I think expects Apple Pie around the Holidays and my dad on his Birthday 

45	I have a dream that one day I will either own my own PicturePerfect Studio where I will get all the business I can handle if not more I love to take photos or snapshots of anything and everything Sometimes I wonder how I will ever get all the pictures organized that I already have I did start a Creative Memories class but shortly after beginning that I moved back to my hometown and now I haven t had time to get around to it because creating a special kind of photo is very time consuming I also have a three year old Riley who would like to just tear into all my stickers and markers and different jagged scissors I use when working with my pictures so I need to wait until his Dad takes him By then I m too tired and I take time to relax and watch a movie instead I also have two girls that also keep me very busy

45	What a powerful message This is the first time I ve read this and was moved by the flowing of this essay Not only as a reality but as a piece of literature It impressed me that he chose to connect with people by using familiar terms I m also equally impressed that he balanced the idea of working towards this freedom with caution regarding the path that is taken to reach that freedom Some groups will use any means to achieve their goal which at times defeats the purpose and makes them like those they oppose 

45	I found it refreshing that the author states to give up worrying about image when writing a familiar essay This is something that has plagued me It s also nice to hear someone describe what I feel like when I finally do settle down to write the concentrated mindlessness that precursors a flow of words 

45	I found this helpful in the distinction between writing familiar essays and writing a theme

45	I found this essay to be very intersting in a weird way There was no doubt in my mind how much this child wanted to learn to play pool I liked how the author told a story that at first seemed inconsequential but then showed how it shaped his entire life The author also made a point as to how that experience effected him socially ps this was really done on july 2nd

45	I want to plant them in my world and tenderly care for them helping them to grow healty and strong I want them to thrive For anyone that has ever worked around children this is often the main goal I know that it has been my goal as a future educator My goal is to see the children thrive But I also want to protect them for the harsh reality that we now live in I don t belive that at the age of five or even six they should have to understand what an attack on U S soil is abduction or murder is Their main concerns should be learning and interacting with kids their own age But the reality is in this day and age that is something that they learn I have worked with many kids through my work study program in high school and I have noticed the importance of how a kid needs to be a kid A child that is forced to grow up to fast is not healthy for any one exspecially the child As teachers we should help children to be kids They only time that they should be a grown up is when they are playing dress up and acting like one Children that have play grown up to soon is devistating and can even cause problems later in life When they are actual grown ups they don t know what the meaning of fun is All they do is work Their life turns into work Trust me that was me a few years ago I never went out with friends or even to school funtions I thought to my self why bother No one at school has the same goals in life as I did At this time I was also fighting a battle with depression That had been going on for a while Then in eight grade I snaped I just could not take it any more After spending 48 hours in lock down I took a good long look at my life and the direction that it was headed in and made many changes in my life Like instead of going out I just wanted time to my self I had friends but now it seemed that they did not share the same goals as I did That was until I moved to Bagley and met my two best friends Tarah and Leah they showed me that I should not let my depression get the best of me They have been through everything with me and they are there when I need someone just to complain to Just as I am there for them Then in 11th grade I started to go up to the elementary school and worked with the kindergardeners on a daily basis this helped me face many of the problems that I was facing because I saw them sruggling and it made me feel better because I could help my self over come my fear by helping them with their s Weather it be learning to read and write to the simplist task of tieing a shoe It both of us happy when I helped them learn a skill that they are going to use in everyday day life So no matter who you are you the simplist way that you can help a child thrive is by just being their to help them if they have a problem 

45	While reading News of The Wild by Scott Russell Sanders I thought of my uncle Don Adamson and the times we spent together building his cabin in northern Minnesota Sanders wrote When America was all wilderness except for occasional villages and orchards and clear fields a journey of any distance was a serious undertaking This reminded me of my uncle because we too would take journeys into the wilderness that were sometimes difficult I helped my uncle build his cabin far in the deep woods of Minnesota What made it so difficult is that there are no roads that would allow a standard size vehicle to enter everything was either brought in by hand or with the use of a four wheeler During our jouney into the woods I can recall a feeling of being one with the land Much of the wood that we used to build this cabin came directly from the forest we cleared in order to make room for the cabin We spent many back breaking days working and on occasion we would visit the closest town just to take a well needed shower and have a home cooked meal I felt as if I was a pioneer back in the old days Sanders essay also reminded me of how our Caucasian culture differs is comparison to the Native American culture He states We will carry a pouch of tobacco to placate the old water monsters along with a water treatment kit to placate the new ones those poisons and parasites we two leggeds have flushed into the remotest rivers and lakes This made me think of how the Native American culture seems to be more in tune with their surroundings Many Native Americans have beliefs that differ from what society has deemed the norm They seem to nurture the land not taking anything of value from it leaving it as they found it after they have been there Whereas the Caucasian culture seems to only look at something for their benefit without concern for what could have been a lasting beauty 

45	I have many fond memories of our past Christmas as the boys were growing up The first Christmas we celebrated after leaving the commune was the first we celebrated as a family Asa the oldest was about four years old Nathanael the second was two and Matthew the third was a little over one year old My memories of that first Christmas are vague we didn t have a tree or other decorations to make our rented trailer festive The following year we were renting a house in the country Our marvelous landlord told us we could cut down a Christmas tree anywhere on the 200 acres he owned This became a tradition Each year Duane and I would bundle up the boys and trek on into the woods in search of a Christmas tree The snow wasn t very deep but we still needed to help the boys through the deeper places because their tiny legs were short To them it seemed as if we d been walking for hours but we d only gone into the woods a couple hundred feet That first year we decided to cut down a Balsam pine tree We forgot to measure the height we needed so we eyeballed it The boys were so excited as we dragged the tree back to the house They were very tired when we finally got home but excitement kept them from complaining Kicking off their boots hats mittens and coats they waited to see what we would do next We still didn t have many decorations A friend had given me some that her mother made in a craft class out of beads and colored pipe cleaners Asa made one or two in kindergarten that year too I popped lots of popcorn filling a brown grocery bag with it so we could make a garland I remember seeing a popcorn garland in some old movie We also picked up some fresh cranberries from the store to put on the garland as well Not being sure how to make it each day I would sit with the boys as they watched a children s program on TV and string popcorn and cranberries Ten popcorn then one cranberry repeating as many times as needed I used a sewing needle and regular sewing thread that was doubled When I would run out of thread I simply tied on more I started the garland a few days before we got the tree and finished it after I tried it out to see if I needed more I actually had too much of the garland and had to cut some off After getting the tree up to the house we realized that it was too tall It s amazing how a tree can look a certain size in the great outdoors and then be a different size when you try to bring it into the house 

45	Memories of my neighbors dog came to me after reading She couldn t bear to see a creature in agony like that in Annie Dillard s The Deer At Providencia It brought back memories of Chelsey a black labrador retriever that was continually neglected She was cooped up in a twelve by four foot kennel without ever having the opportunity to be let out to get some well needed exercise I always felt bad playing with my dog Skippy out in the yard with Chelsey looking on knowing that she could not come out and have some fun and exercise with us I asked on many occasions if I could let her out or take her for a walk but her owners wouldn t let me Those people didn t deserve to have such a beautiful animal I remember how she would look at me her big brown eyes gazing for some attention her ears perked up and head cocked to one side as if to say please save me When I would go to visit with her I would always bring a little something special a juicy bone or some leftovers from dinner I didn t care about her getting fat She had to enjoy something in life That winter I let my dog outside I could hear Skippy barking from over at Chelsey s kennel I went to investigate and found Chelsey breathing very heavily she had about two inches of snow covering her and she couldn t get up I picked her up carried her across the yard trying to go as quickly as possible without making her anymore uncomfortable I then placed her in my pickup and drove her to the veterinary clinic I had the doctor look at her he said that her lungs had filled with fluid due to the lack of shelter in the cold She was suffering from sever pneumonia I notified my neighbors about bringing Chelsey to the veterinarian and about her condition They thanked me in not so much emotion and went to visit her I returned to the veterinarians office and checked on Chelsey again before the owners got there she had not improved I said my goodbyes nowing full well that this would be the end of her misery She was put to sleep 

45	Memories of my grandmother s house and the four of us grandchildren playing for hours there was brought back when reading Time Keeps On Slipping by Eric Ostrowski When he was young he talked of something he was given by his grandmother at the age of five after finding it on one of my expeditions in one of her many cupboards My three brothers Ricky Kenny Stevie as they were called then and I would explore my grandparent s house and grounds for hours There was always something new to discover some new make believe game to play and enough dirt to cover us from head to toe My Aunt Barbara mother s only sibling rented a room from my grandparents She never married We were not allowed to go into her bedroom and I don t believe I ever saw what it looked like Years later when my grandparents purchased a different house she moved out and lived on her own until her early death 

45	Within the essay In The Garden written by Deb Sullivan there was a statement that I feel has great significance in my life I realize that I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden I want to plant them in my world tenderly care for them helping them to grow healthy and strong I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life It would be so much easier as a parent to be able to protect our children from anything that hurts or disappoints them If we could only create a perfect little world for our children filled with love happiness success and good fortune As a parent of a child with special needs I have found this statement to be true so many times I have had to stand back and watch my son be disappointed rejected and taken advantage of I have watched him try so hard to be just like the other kids but never quite succeed I have watched him fill out job applications with miss spelled words and almost impossible to read handwriting because he wanted to do it all by himself I have watched his disappointment when the phone did not ring for an interview after all the time spent filling out those applications with the miss spelled words and the messy handwriting I have watched him stand in the doorway of the dugout cheering on his baseball team because the coaches would not put him in the game because all they were thinking about was winning I have listened to the excuses he made for them saying It s okay There just wasn t enough time for me to get in the game mom One day I went to pick my son up at school for a doctor s appointment he came out of school with different clothes on than he had left the house with When I asked him what happened he informed me that when he got back to his gym locker his clothes were gone He had to get dirty clothes out of the lost and found to replace the ones that had been stolen from him I asked him how that could have happened if he had locked his locker He said I couldn t get the lock to work so I laid it on top of the locker where it would be safe I didn t want the guys to have to wait for me He knew I was upset about his missing clothes He tried to comfort me by saying It s okay mom someone else must have needed my clothes He was so forgiving Somehow he always finds the positive side of any situation As parents it is our nature to want to protect our children from hurt and disappointment However by allowing them to experience the hurt and disappointment it helps them learn to be better people Our son is compassionate forgiving and full of never ending love He is not judgmental or prejudice He accepts people for what they are He survived the harsh elements of life 

45	Tracy Olson College Writing 1 Julie Lundblad July 28 2004 Building Fences I want to build a fence around them and protect them from harsh elements of life I want them to thrive I think we all want that for our children and for other children as well I agree with Deb Sullivan essay In the Garden we want to help those children that would like to have someone to believe in them and listen to what they have to say I want to protect my children from the harshness that they will have to deal with when they get older and meet my ex husband which is their dad He has so much hate for me that he can t see how bad he s harming the children when he refuses to see them He believes that the children will be happy to see him with open arms After my parents divorce my father also thought that when my brother and I got older we would welcome him open arms However I haven t seen or talked to my dad in three years I want to give my children the security they need to have a healthy relationship with their partner and their children one day There are my children s friends that have their father s in their lives and the kid s are lonely even though their father s are there I get a lot of my children s friends over and the first thing they say to my husband and I is why can t my parents be just like you guys These parents sometime forget how they too were once kids and sometimes we get to busy being adults and not thinking about our children so that they can feel safe and thrive In a sense we do build that fence but not the way the children want us to just want us to listen We all can build a fence around anything but we need compassion behind it and we need to let them breath fresh air if not when they break down that fence look out My niece s parents have build fences so high for her that it turned out to be more harmful she can t wait until she s 18 years old and she has told her parents that she is moving out because they have build fences to protect her and they were too high My niece can t do the same things as most kids She s 15 years old and she can not take a walk around her block because her parents think that someone might kidnap her however my son who is 13 years old walk home from the middle school dance and home is by the mall She is also not allowed to walk to the skating rink from my house I have a teenager that we had in our home for the past 3 months that had to adjust being in our home that has structure Before his mom really didn t care where he was just as long as he was home at night He chose to live with us because we have showed our kids we care The relative he was staying with drank a lot and he didn t like that live style there I hope that we have given him something to carry out in his life when he leaves next Monday hopefully he will thrive in life and know that someone does care

45	There is a part in Judith Viorsts essay WHAT ME SHOWING OFF that caught my eye This part is showoffs always run the risk of being thought immodest of being harshly viewed as well showoffs This brought me back to high school where a classmate of mine was the one showing off This was especially true in volleyball and it didn t help that the coach showed favortism toward her This gave her more room to show off with spiking the volleyball She was good at everything She had good grades voted for as homecoming queen well liked and popular also a showoff She was a big time showoff and everyone in our class knew it There was no competing with her She was known to many as a class pet to most of the teachers Now older I see her showing off is not as bothersome to me as it used to be in high school I think being older has changed my perspective as she just has more money and is spoiled The old version I find her being the teacher s pet in almost every class The new version is I still find her snobbish at times I find her to now be active in enjoying life and helping out society in a way that makes her feel a part of good in herself such as painting smiley faces on kids at the carnivals or Sunday school teacher and helping out with vacation bible school I think we all find our way of showing off from time to time sometimes in a good way and sometimes not in a good way Most of us I think just want someone to appreciate us for who we are Some of us are more modest in our showing off and some of us seem to flaunt showing off more than others I tend to find myself in the modest part where my classmate is the one to flaunt herself 

45	Amanda Pickerell July 28 2004 Julie Lundblad Springboard essay 1 Far From Perfect You used to see them every day They used to be the people that everyone admired Their son was the captain of the football team and their daughter was the cheerleading captain Dad worked from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday and Mom made Turkey for dinner and Apple Pie for desert The Perfect Family the family that everyone wanted to be in We often see other people s families in very different eye s than we see our own We see the Mom that makes fresh baked cookies every week We see milk that is delivered to their door step We see the kids with 4 0 grade point averages We may even see the Dad coming home from work to a hot meal and a back rub by his ever devoted wife Maybe our best friend is the Cheerleading Captain Maybe we work with the Dad Whatever part we have in one of the family member s lives we still see the Roses that grow by the door step But there are things that we dont see Like when the daughter ends up pregnant at 16 or when the son is heavy into drugs or alchohol abuse We can t see the mom being abused by her husband or the dad being laid off of work Althought this is a worst case scenario it is a good example of the things that we dont see because we dont want to see also the other people dont want to have us see the imperfections in their perfect lives They can sweep it under the carpet As do all families We all have things to hide THe question here is do you hide your problems and never solve them or do you display it for all to see Alice Hoffman s Essay The Perfect Family tells us what it was like fifty years ago and how every family was portrayed as When I was growing up in the 50 s there was only one sort of family the one we watched on television every day Right in front of us in black and white was everything we needed to know about family values the neat patch of lawn the apple tree the mother who never once raised her voice the three lovely children a Princess a Kitten a Bud and always the father who knew best She knew then that all of the families were not perfect However that is how all people saw other families WHen her parents got a divorce their problems were not as easily hidden She shares that I did not meet another child of divorced parents until 10 years later when I went off the college It is said now that one in two marriages will end in either divorce or a legal separation Our world is no longer seemingly perfect We have mothers that have children out of wedlock and fathers that are alcoholics Every day we see stories of children that do not have enough food for them to eat We also see violence on TV newspapers radio and most recently the internet A person can find recipes for homemade bombs and other such violent weapons Just three years ago we saw Terrorists fly loaded planes full of innocent people into the World trade Center The interesting thing about all of these problems that we see now is that it was the same way then as it is now There were fathers that cheated on their wives and Children starved every day We were fighting wars then and we were shown violence then too What made the difference then Why did we not see all of the same problems then IT might be because it was not acceptable then It was seen as different or abnormal when did it become a normal occurance for families to break apart and destroy any children in that family The moest important question here is Why do we see all of our problems now and why couldnt we see them fifty years ago THE actual truth of the matter is that we had the same problems we saw the same things It was not acceptable then Even though times have changed and our standards have for some reason gone down we also have some things that have changed for the good Anyone that wants to can go to college and get a degree WHites and blacks can eat in the same restureaunt and people can fall in love an not have to worry if they are in the same social class Instead of dwelling on the negitive things why dont we stop and think about all of the things that we take for granted Just take the time to stop and smell the roses

45	Jennifer Parkhurst Springboard 1 Julie Lundblad July 28 2004 His pain is over I read One Hour by Kim Dennig It was a touching story of losing a family member I like the emotion and the love he had for his grandfather Ever since I was very young I ve had an interest in nursing I remember when my grandpa passed away when I was eight years old I thought to myself that if I was a nurse maybe I could have helped him At the young age of eight I realized death is forever When I was twenty I began working as a nurse s aid I worked at Havenwood Care Center in Bemidji I worked at the nursing home for two and half years As a nurses aid I helped the elderly residents with their activities of daily living Many of the residents come to the nursing home They come to live out the rest of their lives in nursing homes It was difficult because they could no longer take care of themselves at home Their skin was fragile and sensitive Some residents had dementia and Alzheimer patients I enjoyed visiting them at supper time and I would talk to the residents that could not speak although the other staff would not I just hope someone would talk to me if I could not speak I was frequently asked to stay over Although exhausted from working the evening shift I would stay and help First rounds at one a m involved a lot of lifting and turning patients We would answer lights and take turns taking residents to the restroom Rounds went by fast and it kept me from being sleepy At three a m it was time to round again Half way though rounds I checked the lady in the second bed and I found something shocking I turned on the light and noticed the woman s skin was yellow and cold Her eyes were open and her leg was hanging over the bed as if she was trying to get up I said her name but she did not answer me Just two hours ago I had spoken to this lady and she said So is it time to get up Wow this was the first person I had actually found dead I felt very confused and I felt like this wasn t real I had no idea this would have such an emotional impact on me I found it was hard to deal with at first I couldn t forget how scary she looked lying in bed starring I didn t know if I would be able to continue to work in this field but as they say time heals all Today I am working at Cass lake Public Health Services hospital Although people die there too I am gaining experience in a variety of areas Now I have three children and I cherish each day that I am able to play with feed and provide for there for them because someday I too will be old 

45	The essay by Stanton L Wormley Jr had a lot of thought to it He was tought to not fight back But a person can only take so much before they decided to change there feelings I like it his ideas were great 

45	The essay I read by Judy Brady was very interesting I thought the lady wanting a wife But it showed the different views of a mother wife I believe she is right that women do alot of things in a family setting Maybe I should have my boyfriend read this essay 

45	I was just asking a girlfriend today a few years younger than I what she thought we d be like as little old ladies Reading this story is like other s I ve read and it make me cringe to think that someday I may need this type of attention I am glad that my mother because of alzheimer s didn t know where she was when we put her in a home I m also thankful that I never had to do that with my father This story definately makes me think of my future and how I would like it to be shaped and what I will do about that while I can 

45	What a novel idea Being both wife and mother I found great pleasure in reading this essay by Judy Brady I love her idea the way she put it across Even now with my children grown and on their own I m still a wife and student It would be nice as she said I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies Among other parts of her idea this will all too soon be a reality as I hit school full time next semester 

45	We try to raise our kids to just walk away Stanton was raised that way and sometimes when we have had a enough we fight back I think anyone would feel good about fighting back when they had no choice However that good feeling is temporary We are taught not to fight back yet there is a certain satisfaction in retaliating Then our hearts take over and we know hurting someone only hurts us 

45	At first I was wondering why would a woman want a wife Then when I read this essay I thought this was the way I felt I had to read it to my husband you would think he would say something NO He didn t you would think that would of made him say hey I m sorry that you would need a wife I will start helping out but No A lot of women can sympathize with Judy some women have husbands that seem to take us for granted and don t understand what we really go though We work harder then we do in the workforce we sometimes work or even go to school and they still expect us to do everything I think we should have this put into a poster to have hanging where our men can see it so they can be reminded how much we do for them 

45	This essay made me aware of what is going on in the inside of Anna Mae I think that we overlook and are not sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of the aged We can see by the outside that there is graying wrinkling aging sagging crippling and decaying and assume subconsciously that that defines the person as a whole When in fact that that is not always the case there may be the mind of a 30 year old in the body of a 84 year old This essay will relate to my reality in the way that I will be more sensitive and understanding of the elderly in my personal and professional life 

45	Blogging of I Want a Wife This essay is a realistic look at the life of a wife When I had first read this essay it seemed to me that there was a tone of what is labeled as man bashing In reading it a second and third time the tone changed When she says As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening it sounds as if it is a matter of fact kind of thought She wasn t angry or resentful she was quietly ironing Her repetition of the I want a wife separates the activities duties jobs and life of a wife I think that if she didn t have this repetition that all of these things would blend into one another and lose the effect of exactly how many things a wife does I can relate to this essay This essay is me I am a wife and a mom I realized what it is that I do I know what I do but have thought about it all separately When it is put down in black and white in one essay it is more powerful The life of a wife is a tremendous task and I would expect that the burnout rate would be high and if it isn t why I would be interested to know what it was that she felt after the realization of what her life entailed Did she accept this description and continue to live her life this way was she angry or did life change in her marriage and her relationship with her husband with regards to equality This essay should be a mandatory read for husbands to be 

45	The author Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver is giving a detailed description of what her life is like in a nursing home in the essay My World Now Throughout the essay she describes how she has lost her privacy independence and her freedom She describes how one mundane day leads into another without any variation Because one day is just like the next it is difficult for her to know what day of the week it is She talks about the residents with Alzheimer s who are not aware of where they are I wonder if she isn t a little envious that they are not aware of their fate The author talks about the fact that even the employees don t stay long because it is not a desirable place to work She states This is not the best job to have They can move on to a better place of employment but she cannot My heart goes out to the author Because people are living longer these days they are often times unable to take care of themselves as they get older Family structure is different today with both parents working and leading busy lives The elderly can depend on their families to take care of them They are forced to go to some kind of care facility to live out their days They loose everything they have worked so hard for even their privacy I don t know what the answer is I only know that my heart breaks every time I must go visit someone in the nursing home 

45	In this essay written by Deborah Tannen pointed out that we as society go out of are way to pick weaak points out of a person speaking This is more so with the media even though we all have the freedom of speech The media itself does pick a person more so then a regular person on the way they speak our what they have to say Even I sit and listen to one talk I am not listening to what they have to say but what there weaknesses are in the story 

45	After reading this essay I got a feeling that Judy Brady was getting the point across as a idea that all men want the same things in a wife and that if she wanted a wife she would have her wife do the same thing as she stated in the essay I though have to disagree with her essay for I think anyone and myself should let his wife do what she wants and make things 50 50 across the board in marrige 

45	After reading Fighting Back written by Stanton L Wormley JR I wondered what I would have done if I had been in his position I would have probably handled things the same way that the author did The author was raised in a upper middle class black family which tells us that life was different for him than other black people from the start The author did not hold the resentment anger and frustration that many poor black people hold He did not have to fight for everything he had Because of his social class the author was not angry at all white men He did not feel the contempt for the white man that the other black soldiers did He felt like he was an equal to the white man which is why he did not fight back when first attacked I think the idea the author was trying to convey was that he almost felt ashamed for not fighting back in the first fight He questioned his response to the fight wondering Was I less of a man for not having beaten my attacker to a bloody pulp Self defense and active and defiant fighting back were the two reasons the author felt that fighting back was justified He felt that fighting back for the black man and other minority groups was a statement of individual potency and self determination The author understood that by not fighting back he had disgraced the entire black population In the authors second fight he did choose to fight back I think he fought back because of all the guilt he had harbored from disgracing his people years ago and also he was probably more aware of the discrimination that his people and other minority groups experience after serving in the military He had experienced life other than the upper middle class life he was accustomed to I found that I had great respect for the author admitting that after his second fight he felt a great sense of hollowness Even though he was justified in retaliating and initially exhilarated by the fight he did not like that he had become like the others and learned to fight back What a good lesson that fighting never solves problems No matter what 

45	After reading I Want a Wife written by Judy Brady I got the distinct idea that the author was feeling taken advantage of by her husband Throughout the essay she gave many examples of all the things that she would like a wife to do if she could have one I think that what she was really saying is that she wanted some recognition and appreciation for all the things she does for everyone else on a daily basis She wanted someone to pamper her and make sure that everything was taken care of for her I think the idea of this essay is to make us aware of all the things the woman or wife is expected to do for the family Why is it the wife that always has to make the sacrifices Why is it the wife that thinks of everyone else first This essay is so typical of families today There are certainly exceptions to this stereo typical relashionship between husband and wife but for the most part I am sure that a lot of wives can relate to what the author is talking about I liked the way the author ended the essay I think what she was saying was not only did her husband not appreciate her and all she does for him and the family but he expects more Somehow her husband puts no importance on his wives wants and desires I never thought about it but maybe I would like a wife also 

45	Inthis essay by Deborah Tannen She points out how as a society we like to argue in order to get our way And that the media often does not give to side to an issue Because they want to have you side with them Which I think is wrong because how can we as a society make a fair judgement when we are only hearing half of the story Even on talk shows people like to argue I think somethings they do this just to get attention Why would you want to argue just to argue It is a waste of time and of energy And after a while no one wants to listen to you because all you want to do to them is have a fight and this is not right to the other person or people involved We all argue But arguing all the time is not good for your selfesteam and it make make people around you negative also It can lead to anxity depression spouse abuse child abuse and much more I think this is one of the main problems in are society to day is that we can t talk problems out without someone yelling at the other person and this hurts everyone involved not just the people who are disagreing with each other 

45	In this essay by Judy Brandy the author explains how a friend of hers recently got divorced and had a child from a previous marriage and they got to talking and he told her that he wanted a new wife That got Judy thinking how she wants a different wife One that will do everything a wife is suppoes to do while the husband is out making a living for the family Well the reason that Judy wants a new wife is because she is doing everything including the man s job and that is not easy In this essay I think that Brandy teaches you that the women should not have to do everything at home But in many cases this is just the case Well both parents may be working outside the home The mother is mainly responsible for taking care of everything at home It is not like women can t do anything that men can t but many think the Leave it to Beaver way Where the mother is at home and may work outside the home occassional While it is the fathers responsiblity to earn the living for the family Leaving all the household duties to mom I don t think this is right just because we have been classified as the more materinal gender It would not kill a man to help out around the house After all he lives there to Even everyone in awhile take care of the inner family needs like making sure the kids are taken care of appointments are scheduled and even the housework is done Many Women would apperciate this 

45	The ideas I found in this essay writtne by Wormley FIGHTING BACK were drama and race He was treated unfairly because of the color of his skin I just hate that The drama I found was in his will not to fight back because this is how he was brought up When confronted byanother black man of why he chose not to was something that he hadn t thought of It hadn t entered his mind The drama also was hitting the next guy in the stomach when he wouldn t leave him alone When translating this to reality I find black race are not treated equal yet I feel white people have more rights yet and the black race fights twice as hard as white people to prove themselves I have a friend who transferred to my shool during the teen years Noone seemed to want to help her find the classrooms I helped her and we are friends to this day She is native american and actually helped my self esteem improve 

45	The author Stanton L Wormley Jr in his essay FIGHTING BACK talks of his difficult upbringing as an only child and he still was adjusting at eighteen when he was an army private at Fort Jackson S C where a drunken white soldier attacked him during his sleep and the thought of fighting back had not entered his mind Later he was confronted angrily by a young black street wise soldier wondering why he didn t fight back In a roadside diner in Virginia Wormley was confronted again by a drunken white man making derogatory remarks at him He did try ignore him and move but the man grabbed his shoulder He pulled him up out of his chair and hit the drunk guy in the stomack dropping him to the floor He thought of how this left him feeling good for the moment and then lost something by leaving him with a hollow feeling afterwards In his upbringing he was taught to think more than react Fighting disgraced his black american population He had a trace of sadness in knowing he had learned to fight back I found this essay sad in some parts By this I am referring to race It shouldn t matter what color you are Wormley was judged by that his color I find this wrong He was trying to do good for himself and drunken white ment were in the wrong by attacking him They re the ones making white people look bad 

45	The author Judy Brady in I WANT A WIFE is good I can see her point As a mother why not have someone anyone to take care of us for a change This essay makes her sound unhappy and exhaused in her role as a mother She is ironing and what comes to her mind is Yeah why not get or have a wife She s thinking of her divorced friend and sees why he wants someone To take care of his needs and his one child She almost sounds angry or bitter at the role she plays because I think her duties are unappreciative in her household In this case I d like a wife too In reality it is a fifty fifty deal to me Working together because an income now a days takes two people to make it in this world today and with that I would say IT TAKES TWO to accomplish the routine of everyday life When both making incomes there needs to be an agreeable arrangement of working together in the home equally as partners so transitions can run smoothly as possible 

45	The auther Judy Brady in I WANT A WIFE starts out with a male friend recently divorced who has one child with his ex wife and now looking for another wife She goes on talking of how she thought of him when ironing one night and how she d like a wife for herself meaning for someone to take care of her and run errands keeep track of dental and doctor appointments mend clothes feed kids arrange school events take them to the park and so on While reading this essay I found her repetition in wanting a wife mentioned over and over again Things such as I want a wife to take care of my children or I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick or I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements or wanting a wife who is faithful honest entertains and is a good cook This essay sounds like the woman is the jack of all trades and does more than a man has to In the world today this essay leaves the reader with false accusations In the way wives nurture others I find this si habit in being brought up Today roles have changes with the mother working and the father watching and raising kids Today it is whatever works out Some people are single parents such as myself doing the Mr Mom Every household is different so this essay I find distracting It sounds like she is unhappy in her role of motherhood I think by nature mothers are nurturers at heart Most of us are I believe some of it comes natural As a single parent it is oberbearing at times but I love my kids They have responsibility with helping when I haven t a spouse to rely on Sometimes that would be nice I ve adjusted to the single parent role I may not always like it but I do what I can 

45	In this essay Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver is writing from how she see s her world now compares to before She writes about the treatment she gets while living where she does and how it makes her feel less like a human She explains how she spends a typical day either in bed or watching T V Anna explains what happens when people die and how it s just like another day for the workers and she also tells about the comforts of the wheelchair I like this essay because it s not a essay thats all complaining As a reader I can tell she s not complaining she s just trying to open others eyes as to how she feels and how she s treated now that she s in a nursing home She tells about her world before and how it is now I can tell she excepts why she s there it s just hard to except how she s treated 

45	Judy Brady wrote this essay from a wives perspective of a wife More so of wife writing from how she is seen by her husband eyes She writes from how she feels he sees her and wants her to act After reading this essay I Want A Wife the reader can tell that this relationship isn t a two way ordeal it s more of the wife doing all the giving and the husband doing all the recieving Basically the only similarities betweent them are that they both are living for him She s working to care for him and so is he For most women this essay could be quite similar to their own lives how the husband are so dependant upon their wives Growing up and seeing how my parents are together I can say this essay is nothing like them My parents are equal with everything they share all the responsibilities and really respect eachother I liked this essay because it was true It was written from experience and after reading it I could tell that the writer wrote this because she needed to get her feelings out She probable felt it was the only way she could be heard and understood 

45	Anna Mae Halgrin Seaver s Essay My World Now shares the life of an 84 year old woman in a nursing home she shares her feelings on being old and how she feels neglected and how her feelings do not seem to matter I think the tone of this essay is one of reflection The woman in the essay is sharing how she feels to have everything taken away from her TO be put into a place where she is forced to have a roommate and when there is nothing to live for anymore When she was counting the minutes till lunch i thinkthat it was the writers way of really making us see howlife was for her in a nursing home I dont think that i could be happy in a home I am a free spirited person and i dont want anyone to take that away from me They cant 

45	In the Essay I Want aWife the author Judy Brady Writes of her experiences as a wife and a woman I think that she is trying to share her feelings on the work that is required of her as a woman I think that the ideas in this essay are trying to portray How she is tired of being the one in her family to do all of the work I thinkthat a woman should be more than a mom and a nurse The woman s job is becoming more flexible and less restrictive I think that brady s essay is one that shows how she feels when all things are said and done 

45	I found this essay to be weird although I loved the way Cynthia Williams the author described her experiences with garbage I guess I can see what she is talking about how the garbage itself is lonely I can only imagine that she herself must be lonely Although I do believe that she may require some psychiatric help she does have a way with garbage and how it relates to her life first coming and then going I do believe that we all should take the resposibility for our waste But I don t believe that one should thrive in it 

45	I found this essay to be very one sided The author Judy Brady was simply trying to state every aspect of a womans life that chooses to be this way bitter I m sorry she s not appreciated she chooses to have these feelings on the basis of her mate I have not and do not condone the way the author speaks in this essay because she obviously thinks she is much more than equal to a male She has deffinatley made some bad decisions in her life if she thinks that all of the things she describes are of her own responsibility She makes me mad to think that there are people out there that have no respect either for themselves or their mate I believe that a relationship is a 50 50 venture and that in itself deserves respect 

45	I liked this essay because I can incorporate the idea of him wanting to retaliate He doesn t retaliate the first time because he was raised not to His idea is when do we retaliate and what does it take for us not to retaliate I think that retaliation is something we all fight as a silent battle within each and all of us I know I do I am made fun of talked about at worked teased and meant to feel bad This man feels the same way because of his color He is proud of being black but everyone else is scared because of his color People are afraid of the unknown This man was the stronger man because he didn t fight back the first time but when he fought back the second time he felt ashamed because he had let the monster fighting inside out to show his true feelings of what he feels about people who retaliate against black people just because they are black 

45	This essay made me mad I read this essay at least three times and the more I read it the more it made me angry First of all at the beginning of this essay I couldn t decide if this author was male or female it really was a confusing idea The idea of this essay was wanting a wife because of what duties a wife has or takes on in her role as a wife I think that the author to this essay was basically bringing out the sterotypes put on wives I am a wife and I don t do all those things all the time My husband shares the responsibility or we take turns This essay sounds like it s from a males perspective who wants to be free and wants a mother not a wife someone to wait on him hand and foot so he can take credit for the wife s hard work while he just looks important This was not a good essay I feel because he makes it sound like the old days when the wife used to do it all and that is the way it is now Well it s not It takes two to run a household and the household shares all the responsibility of running the house 

45	Deborah Tannen the author of this essay presents all the ways that people try be a critic One example is how the media preys on public interest by posing difficult questions which catch the interviewees off guard When we as listeners hear these questions we assume this is the generally held opinion of our society She points out that the path to truth is not necessarily as easy as it appears There are many ways we try to get there including public discourse finding the weak spots in the people you are debating and trying to find the other side This is definitely an easy essay to relate to the real world Face it we do these things We argue just to argue We attack another s point of view just because it doesn t tango with ours We even lie sometimes because we are just so sure we know the other person is not telling the truth We can have no way of knowing for sure what another is thinking or that they are intentionally lying I loved the illustration of the irate talk show guest I have always been disgusted with anger driven talk shows where none of the issues are really presented and it s all a bunch of screaming fanatics who don t listen to a single word of what the other person is saying except to attack it and call them raving lunatics It s sad that it has gotten to this point People don t want to hear both sides they want to see these distinguished guests holler near obscenities at each other Arguing for just for the sake of it Justification for inappropriate behavior The first paragraph illustrated this When a journalist was asked why she had to attack others so she could be right she replied It s an argument This essay got me thinking about my own life personally I don t want to end up a bitter old woman with opinions so set that she is blinded to what might really be true I liked this lengthy line But when opposition becomes the overwhelming avenue of inquiry when the lust for opposition exalts extreme views and obscures complexity when our eagerness to find weaknesses blinds us to strengths when the atmosphere of animosity precludes respect and poisons our relations with one another then the culture of critique is stifling us It really sums up the whole point of his essay I m not sure if this is what Julie meant by putting the ideas behind essays into real life Sorry if I misunderstood 

45	In this essay by Judy Brady she tells all the reasons that she would personally want a wife Being a wife she wishes SHE had a wife to do all of the things that she has to do I get the impression that she really doesn t like her position in the family Obviously she has some pride in what or rather how many things she does but she doesn t seem to get much appreciation In a way she is presenting her own life through her husband s eyes and I have a feeling all is not well in paradise This essay is probably well received by many wives I am not a wife myself hallelujah a shaft of light and angelic voices but I liked it I get mad at myself when I take my mother for granted and just basically anyone in my life And it s so doggon easy to do Many wives probably feel this way Problem after problem arises and they are expected to handle it because the man has been working all day It s a pity that this author felt so frustrated that she had to write something like this It s a pity she felt she needed a wife It s a pity she felt unappreciated and harried I m sure Brady voiced what many women wish to voice But I wonder how many men are feeling this way too The grass is always greener 

45	Anna Mae Halgrim Seaver s essay My World Now is a very insightful essay about the treatment of elderly people in nursing homes It also allows us to see what people in nursing home are thinking day to day Seaver exposes the idea that nursing homes are very lonely not very dignifying and very boring All of these ideas go through my very own head at work everyday I work in a nursing home and often wonder how boring it must be Everything seems to be revolved around breakfast snack lunch snack dinner and finally another snack Seaver s expresses this when she describes her day of getting up early waiting for breakfast and then pondering waiting in the dining room for lunch Obviously she feels that there is not much to look forward to during the day other then the meals that are served Seaver expresses the idea that aides in a nursing home don t take time to listen I know that this is a fact Many times I find that we are very short on help and even though we would like to take time to chat we just don t have that luxury I feel it a tragedy that we are forced to run around like chickens with our heads cut off when all these people want most of the time is someone to listen I also think that people are encouraged not to get too close to the resident by spending a lot of time with them I have had experiences where I was taking the extra few minutes that I had to visit with a certain resident who was telling me all about his kids When I was spotted doing this by a co worker I was told that I shouldn t get so close I didn t look at this as getting close I looked at it as caring Overall the feelings that are expressed in this essay are very much valid I can not imagine having to live in an environment like a nursing home especially if I had my mind about me as Seaver does in this essay 

45	As I read the essay My World Now I was compelled to think of the people that I see everyday at work I work in a nursing home and can relate to the things that this lady is experiencing I often wonder what these people did or enjoyed when they were younger Many times while working though we as aides unfortunately don t have the time to stop and ask or listen as we would like I find it refreshing to have a day when we are not short of help on the floor and can spend the time that is deserved these people under our care 

45	I Want a Wife written by Judy Brady is an essay that seems to rally for sympathy for wives Brady explains throughout the essay all of the reasons that she would want a wife and what she would expect them to do She also writes that if she had a wife she would have the right to find a new wife if she so desired I get the feeling that Brady a wife herself does not like the position that she is in There is a very strong idea presented in this essay that wives have many expectations placed on them by there spouse family and society These expectations are expressed in a negative way in this essay For two entire pages Brady writes phrases and ideas such as I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs I want a wife who will keep my house clean I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied I don t feel that there is anything wrong in wanting a wife to do these things However I get the feeling from this essay that Brady does not get the same respect from her spouse as she is expected to put out I feel that each spouse has a role in there family If my husband were to make enough money that I could stay home I would I would then have no problem doing all of the cooking cleaning pleasuring Reality however is different In the real world of today many families have both spouses working When this is the case the husband and wife should share the house hold responsibilities I strongly feel that if life is so rough for Brady then maybe she should start looking for a new husband just as their friend is looking for a new wife 

45	Fighting Back is an essay that is very compelling to think about Naturally one may think or feel the same way Morris did in the essay and wonder why Wormley did not fight back Fighting back for so many is just an instinct that is done before thought has a chance to take place Wormley however was raised to think before he acted I really liked this essay for pointing out that fighting back may not always be the best answer Sometimes thinking your way through a situation may lead you to a better result and feeling about yourself 

45	Jennifer Parkhurst One Page Paper Julie Lundblad July 20 2004 Reaction to The Right To Die Norman Cousins in his essay The Right To Die talks about a married couple at the end of their life They felt if they weren t able to take care of themselves they why take you the space They didn t want their lives prolonged It was their rights if they wanted to live In the essay the man said We are not afraid to die This was their right to live The essay was a narrative essay because someone else is telling the store of Van Dusen It used repetition to reinforce the point of the essay They didn t like the fact of taking up space when other people need help In religion the human mind finds a larger dimension and is relieved of the ordeal of a confrontation with non existence Death is not the greatest loss in life These are some of the examples from the essay The tone of the essay was sad I like the essay because it is true People should have the right to choose if they want to live or not The last paragraph in the essay death is not the greatest loss in life The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live The unbearable tragedy is to live without dignity or sensitivity It makes a good point that people who go into nursing homes loss their dignity That is why they give up and the greatest loss dies inside them This essay made me think a lot of what the elderly think It also gave me ideas of how to write more essays 

45	I really liked how William Zinsser started out his introduction in comparison to something most everyone can relate to Clutter is like fighting weeds a person has to weed out the ones that don t fit or look good I really liked how in his essay he gave numerous examples It didn t really keep my attention the whole time in the beginning I was really interested but towards the end I lost that intrest I think he was throwing a lot of information into this essay it was almost overwhelming how he jumped around so much But all together it was a pretty good essay that pointed out different aspects of cluttering 

45	I think E B White used a great deal of imagery and emotion when writing this story on part in particular caught my eye They stayed indoors kept warm and ate well and when there was nothing better to do they played crokinole The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay Mr White gave me as a reader an essay of great contrast and details to make me feel the Dwelling of this family falling apart 

45	I think Norman is talking from his point of view on suicide and how much of it is none sense to the common folk and that we as humans must see all sides of it before judging one on his our her actions I think there is one great part to this essay that describes this very well Even without respect to religion the idea of suicide has been abhorrent throughout history Some societies have imposed severe penalties on the families of suicides in the hope that the individual who sees no reason to continue his existence may be deterred by stigma his self destruction would inflict on loved ones I feel this is the point that he wanted to get across 

45	Jennifer Parkhurst One Page Paper Julie Lundblad July 19 2004 Reaction to The Family Which Dwelt Apart E B White wrote an essay called The Family Which Dwelt Apart it was about a family that lived on a island far from people They would go off the island when they needed something from the town One winter they were stuck on this island because of the bad whether Someone in town heard that one of the kids of the Pruitt had appendicitis and sent people to help them Some of the people died and they tried to help the boy but he ended up dying anyway The house burned to the ground and the last boy found a town to live in The tone of the story was up bet The story showed the start with the best place and time to put the reader in the right mindset to absorb details when it starts on an island and the boy appendicitis ruptured It showed a family on a small island living the way they wanted to live Then the storm broke out and they were trapped on the island with no resource Finally the boy died and the brother moved away I like this essay because it showed a happy beginning and a sad ending I liked the part where the whole town tried to help them off the island It showed how people help each other 

45	In the begining of the essay wrote by author William Zinsser he discusses how fighting clutter is like fighting weeds and how new varities are always sprouting up over night When I first read this story I thought that he was talking about the clutter that we have in our lives through material possesions But as I read on I soon came to realize that he meant through one s writing and how as a society we have learned to not be able to cut to the chase Throughout this essay he states that we should simplifly our lives by looking at our writing and changing it I know that this might seem hard but it can be done so says the author of Clutter So Simplify sinplify and your life will be better 

45	The essay Women in the wild blue younder discusses the right for women to do anything that they want to exspecially fly in combat I don t see why women should not be allowed to do this because like the author states they could get hurt in any other job that they do One point in this story that puzzles me is the question Can a nurturer also be a destroyer But when you look at the issue women have been involved in the war forces for many years Yes as many different parts and yes never as combat flyers But we have still played an active role in the one thing that keeps are country safe and I think that is very important 

45	I grew up in a Christian home that suicide is against God and we will not be able to go to heaven I can sympathize with Dr Van Dunsen and his wife in taking their lives I would want to take my life if I had a serious illness that I couldn t handle I agree that I would feel like I was taking up a space in the world too I don t see it that way when an elderly gets sick I m one of those that would like to take care of them I would be there for them when they want to talk 

45	I thought it was a good essay I could relate to the essay by how I wonder about antique pictures and what the people were thinking or how their lives were I wonder if they had fun in live or if they live like we do these days 

45	This was a crazy story one that as I was reading didn t expect to end the way it did The writer wrote in a tone that was relaxed and calm I assumed by the title that they just all went their seperate ways in life It was written in more of a story than an essay Instead of crazy I should actually say it was more Ironic The people that came to help them out and save them actually end up killing them another thing I didn t expect Everything happened so suddenly I had to read it twice to see if what happened actually happened Right away I didn t know what to think I had some mixed emotions and thoughts All around it was an okay essay 

45	I found the title The family which Dwelt Apart fit the essay perfectly Seven on an island that end up stranded with mentioning of appendicitus set off huge problems with state troopers sending a rescue squad and three lost their lives I found this essay to be confusing I had to read it twice I did like it After figuring out E B White uses a tell tale this helped put these images in my mind and I find this can t be possible for all this to happen The pruitts died from drinking carbolic acid that was left behind by the surgeon whic Pa Pruitt had mistaken for alcohol The oldest boy charles returns giving his family decent burial and returns to the mainland I find E B white uses imagination in the essay and as I am reading this I find my emotions going in all sorts of directions One minute I m shocked and another I am chuckling because of the detailed work with so many bizarre incidents The reader is keeping my attention in the story with different events going on I found the essay powerful sad and hilarious A Hard to Believe Story 

45	I must admit that even after reading this story a number of times I am still confused Did the author want us to be confused Was this story written for the humor The author certainly demonstrated how one misunderstanding can lead to another misunderstanding and so on What confused me the most was who ever led anyone to believe that anyone had appendicitis The author mentioned it at the beginning of the story for what seemed like a random statement and before you knew it the whole thing got blown out of proportion I like the authors statement The winter would have passed quietly enough had not someone on the mainland remembered that the Pruitts were out there in the frozen bay This statement kind of summed up the whole story The Pruitts were very happy and content until someone assumed that they were not I found the setting of a remote island to very appropriate for the story The Pruitts found the isolation they desired but by doing so they actually made more problems for themselves The lack of contact with society created more chaos than had they checked in on a regular basis and not let people wonder what was happening 

45	This story reminds me of my Grandmother She too was an artist that was not allowed to follow her passion because she was a female At first I thought that this story was actually being written by Mary Cassatt because of the great detail given by the author throughout the story I realized towards the end that it was actually written by her niece The author did such a nice job describing and creating a mental image of Mary Cassatt from her desire to be an artist to the sacrifices she made in order to fulfill her dream I like the statement the author used She typifies one kind of independent American spinster who keeps reappearing in our history in forms as various as Margaret Fuller and Katharine Hepburn The author demonstrated a deep understanding of these woman from their love life to their old age Thank goodness there were woman and still are that dare to go against what society believes they woman should do I found it ironic and sad that Mary Casatt lost her eye site in her old age Her art was the focus of her whole life and then to not be able to see Her life was truly a lonsome life but she felt she had accomplished her goal 

45	I found this essay ironic in that I recently went to a garage sale at a storage facility They were holding a sale for items that were in storage The owner stopped paying their storage fees moved or the item were repossessed for inability to pay rent I came across a picture of an older lady From the looks of the frame and the clothes that the lady wore it was from the seventies I wondered too if she had had family or had passed away and this was what was left of her I felt saddened at the thought of this picture sitting up against the table on the floor dirty Where were her daughters and sons Why would they let a picture of her mother lay there like that When Julie mentions If they had family that s the one that sticks in my throat if they had family could they be this forgotten this neglected this saddened me I am from a close family and this made me think that I am fortunate and blessed The last paragraph brings to my mind how we sometimes will judge others come to conclusions and stereotype or assume things before we know and see the whole picture 

45	I thought that the artical clutter was a very appropriate name I think that the author was trying to make a point By using clutter in the artical Tha author created a sense of ironacy I dont know if that is even a word Did anyone really find a point in this essay I didn t 

45	This essay my where to start My opinion is the same after reading this essay as it was before I think it was masterfully written and if I wasn t already so strongly decided on this issue I most likely would have tilted towards Cousin s viewpoint I am 100 percent against assisted suicide I believe it is completely and totally not up to us to decide when our lives should be over I think it is up to God who has an infinitely vaster and greater perspective on what is going on in this nutty world Blushes and steps off her soapbox I can recognize how people would disagree with me and this essay certainly points them out Mentioning a prominent couple who chose to murder themselves the author brought us to the reality that it s an issue we all have to face Again had I not been clearly decided on suicide I might have been swayed by the author s persuasive and almost inescapable examples I cannot and will not agree with him though 

45	It was rather thought provoking I was expecting an essay on packrats even when I had already skimmed it It was sort of hard for me because I love big words and meshing them together I do get sick of all the pre canned phrases and conversation starters though In this essay the author certainly gave a lot of examples Almost too many in my opinion Each one made sense and opened my eyes more to the growing clutter in our language but I almost got sick of this essay Just my opinion It s one of those essays I m not sure if I like or not I just read it so give me a moment I can see his point In some ways we re losing ourselves in all the expected phrases and socially acceptable conversations I thought it was funny how this author certainly wasn t shy with big words and long sentences It was almost cluttered 

45	This story reaffirms the teaching in class Wednesday night It helped me to rethink and restructure my writing while strengthening my resolve to do it better William Zinsser shows clear examples of how many adjectives are unnecessary in our writing I don t know if I ll be able to change my speech habits but there is something I can do with my writing Writing for retail sales you are taught to be very descriptive This may be how some of these extraneous words were introduced into our language 

45	I found this a difficult story to read but would like to comment on it If you re not aware what time period Mary Cassatt lived in quotes from the first paragraph help you to define the period I would rather see you dead her father said of her decision to become a painter Even painter Degas said I am not willing to admit that a woman can draw that well The author continues she talks about the paradoxes of the woman artist what Mary would have to overcome and the things she had going for her The time period is mentioned when Mary s mother dies and you understand even more the issues that Mary faced Even after 28 years abroad as a renowned Impressionist painter a Philadelphia newspaper said She has been studying painting in France and owns the smalles Pekingese dog in the world They down played her renown nothing was mentioned about all the famous painters who esteemed their female colleague 

45	The author William Zinsser describes his essay CLUTTER deeply One example at this point in time is simplified with the word now To examine every word on paper is hard He states her personal physician to be her doctor Zinsser mentions clutter being the enemy in any form He mentions starting out clutter is like fighting weeds This will smother what you write He quotes many examples like invasion a reinforced protective reaction strike The quote This will interest you is more likely to distract the readers attention finding it dull The writer is speaking of unnecessary words and ends with the last sentance Simplify simplify Zinsser uses repitition throughout his essay One example is It s raining The weatherman says At the present time we are experiencing precipition This is unnecessary jargon His essay points this out clearly with his many examples I found this essay hilarious I liked how he stated his examples from long sentances to one word I enjoyed the words we eliminated last week His last sentance I found to be powerful with the word simplify He used one word instead of saying Cut your Clutter 

45	I found this essay very interesting I now know that I am not he only one that looks at old photograghs and wonders why they are not on a family members wall They must be someones great grandparents or relative The questions that the author asked who it was that sold a family treasure a relative who can not name the face or family were very intriguing and brought even more questions to my mind Ithink of my grandmother who has pictures from a hundred years past of her great grandpartents and those of my grandfather as well when I read this essay To her the pictures mean so much Every time that we are together she has a new picture that she has found or figured out just how they are related to her children and their children However I feel callous at times when I am not that interested because I can tie no personal memories or attachments to these people 

45	This essay was hillarious and sarcastic I loved the say that he pointed out the multiple extra fluff words and expressions that we use in our english language everyday and we are now accustom to hearing We don t even think twice when the weather man states At the present time we are experiencing precipitation That is just the way they talk and we take their language as a part of them Never have I heard a professional weather man state It s raining and leave it at that Is the jargon really what makes these people professionals in so many peoples minds 

45	Jennifer Parkhurst One Page Paper Julie Lundblad July 14 2004 Reaction to Picnics and Milk Stacy Jurgens her paper Picnics and Milk was a story of a little girl and her family It starts on her grandparent s farm where her family lives out in a trailer Both of the little girls would go out and get milk for super everyday She then describes her father and all the hard work he does for his family The mother and father cared for each other At the end they had a picnic and her parents were deeply in love The essay I thought was an illustration essay it gives ideas and pictures of the story For example we would have supper on the table and large cool glass of milk setting at each place The little girls would get the milk from the barn and her father coming to help them with the milk to the house She also gave realistic images of her parents in the long grass kissing I like to essay It had a lot of feeling and illustration It showed that you can use a memory of your past and describe it I thought was a great writer What I like the most form this essay is the last paragraph these memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday It shows her feelings for her parents and that she too wants to be a good parent for her children

45	Before I had read this piece my view of suicide was that it was wrong a selfish act against what the Catholic Church believes and an easy way out of a difficult situation After I read this my views are open a little more to the thought that there are other logical ethical and moral issues out there other than my closed views Some thoughts that I found in the essay that were of interest to me were They didn t like the idea of taking up space in a world with too many mouths and too little food They believed it was a misuse of medical science to keep them technically alive what they were turning against was the notion that there were no circumstances under which life should be discontinued and life can beprolonged by science far beyond meaning or sensibility The one sentence that made me really stop to think about suicide is The general reaction to suicide is bound to change as people come to understand that it may be a denial not an assertion of moral or religious ethics to allow life to be extended without regard to decency or pride This also lends me to think that what other denials in our life to we hold onto and attach a moral or religious ethic or excuse onto so that we don t have to face the truth 

45	I really enjoyed this essay Even though I did not grow up on a farm Stacy s description of her childhood easily crosses over to mine It brought images of my grandparents and picnics with my family to mind It also brought back images of my sister and I and the little sneaky things we used to try to get away with Especially when she says stolen sips of whole milk and standing there with my sisters peeking at my kissing parents through the long grass I like the last paragraph in that she talks about how she wants for her children what she had growing up I think that we all want more for our children In wanting that for them we sometimes forget to also instill hard work and determination and to not forget the simple things are sometimes the best in life

45	In Limited seating on Broadway THe author John Hockenberry refers to the mistreatment of those with dissabilities When he mentioned about the theater and how they did not take ticket orders over the phone for people with dissabilities I think that the writer of this essay made it plain right there that the theater discriminated against disabled persons The MAnager comes out wavimg a copy of a policy for disabled patrons like it was the bible AFter humiliatin the author he then proceeds to show him to the door or the floor in his case Hockenberry uses this story to not only share how it felt to be a person with dassabilities but also to show a side of people that is usually not ever shown to anyone A persons fear can prevent someone from getting to know those that are different THe author used very discriptive words in describing how he was treated Discrimination of people with special needs is not only moraly wrong but it is also a crime that many people commit on an every day basis and dont even know it When people can accept everyone they will not have all of the problems that they would normally have 

45	I think that the author John HockenBerry describes just how it feels for a person with any type of disability I thought this idea was carried very well through out the essay Some examples of this harsh treatment includes how the manager of the theater was unwilling to help him enjoy the theatoical proformace How he had to carry a bottle of urine fourty blocks because there was not a suitable restroom for him to use I really found it instresting on how he tells us about the proposal for handicapped accessible public restrooms on public streets and how the city opposed puting them in because the Public Art Commission had stated that the structure were just too ugly No one should have to feel insucure just because they have a disability They should have the same rights as everyone else No matter what your race age or type od disability you have 

45	In this story I feel the author used very good imagery Right from the begining he gave me this feeling He opeing sentance was using great emotion and imagery and I feel there is not to many other words of choice to tell you how well he does throughout the essay with using in great depth what it was like in the prison on a exceution day A good example of the author s imagery start like this Two of them stood by with rifles and fixed bayonets while the others handcuffed him passed a chain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts and lashed his arms tight to his sides To me this gives me great imagination what the prisoner was going through and what the guards were doing 

45	When John Hockenberry speaks about the art community in New York City you would never guess where this story was leading and I like that In the second paragraph he speaks of them as having a reputation for being progressive He then goes on to say the theater world likes to think of itself as a seeker of such challenges and is proudest when a play or musical becomes a vehicle for change It doesn t look like they were being much of a vehicle for change as the manager told him he d have to leave It seems that all the people in the arts community couldn t have cared less since no one dared to step forward to help him or defend his right to be there I noticed the reinforced authority of the manager as he was holding the copy of Policy for Disabled Patrons The irony of this story is spelled out in the author s last sentence Art and theater are nothing if not honest 

45	I was not excepting to read about a guy that was in a wheelchair I feel his anger about the house manager coming over with a policy for disabled patrons they should of told him that when he bought the tickets I don t think that its right to not have a theater accessible to any one 

45	I found it interesting how the story about the authors love for her garden evolved into a story about her nephews and how her garden helped her work out the problems she was having with them I love how she refers to her garden as a friend I can relate to this She talks about how she finds solace in working the soil and how pulling weeds relaxes her When something is troubling her she goes to her garden to work out her problems She talks about her difficulty having children and her disapproval of her brother and sister in laws divorce She talks about how the divorce has affected her nephews from her perspective For example the author feels They have been forced prematurely into adulthood and hide the scars of their pain under layers of affected indifference Is this indeed the case Are not all 15 year olds indifferent to the world other then themselves Could it be that because she has not raised children yet herself that she can not understand this She also states I have learned to force thoughts of the two of them wandering the streets with their other latch key friends from my mind Are they truly wandering or is she a little jealous because she might think had these been the children she could not have she would have done something differently It is very easy to judge others until we have actually been put in the same situation I feel the author raises some very valid points but I am also glad that she realizes that these are not her children to raise and she has done the right thing by praying that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish She can not protect them by building a fence around them as she stated Her garden and friend has helped her to realize this 

45	I found this essay to be very thought provoking The author was writing this story from first hand experience I found it interesting how at first the author referred to the prisoner as a puny wisp of a man with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes It was if the author had to somehow justifying they were doing by finding some negative qualities in the prisoner The author never did state what the prisoners crime had been As the Essay unfolded the author began to realize that not only was this a prisoner but he was also a human being with feelings just like his own For example when the author stated Once in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder he stepped lightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path It is curious but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy conscious man When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery the unspeakable wrongness of cutting a life short when it is in full tide It seemed that all of the people involved in the hanging had become desensitized to what they were doing I think that the dog that showed up threw them all off guard because the dog was so innocent and unaware of what was going on I think the dog symbolized the reality of what they were actually doing Even the superintendent also the doctor had a hard time declaring the man dead He only said He s all right I assumed he could not say the word dead because then he would have to take some responsibility for his death I think this essay was about the author realizing that these prisoners were human beings just like himself and what they were doing was not acceptable He also found himself questioning how quickly life returned to normal as they got further away from where the hanging had taken place 

45	I thought this was a wonderful story You could tell that the author wrote this with thoughts of love happiness and a great feeling of security Throughout the story the author used many examples describing the love she felt from her family For example We saw no problem with our parents sneaking some afternoon loving into their busy days There s a good feeling you get even at the age of five when you see your parents madly in love with each other She also talked about the teasing that went on amongst the family members I think this teasing suggests that she was very secure in their love I think the most significant statement the author made was at the end of the story She stated These memories from my childhood embody everything that I want for my children someday I want them to appreciate what they have and work for what they get just as my sister and I did with the milk I think this statement speaks for itself because why would you want to raise your own children as you had been raised if it wasn t a wonderful experience 

45	In george Orwell s short essay A Hanging He starts his story in Burma There is a hindu man condemed to death I found it interseting how first of all the Hindu Man s crime was never menntioned I think that made one to wonder if a crime had even been committed As the writer uses extreamly descriptive words he leads us with him on that fatefull morning that a hanging occured WE are able to follow the superintendants every step of the way to the final hanging I do wonder what signnificance the stray dog had to the man and the story I think that the writer was trying to make a connection to animals and humans in pain 

45	I thought it was very moving I feel her pain that she has about how the parents handled the divorce and how they are acting after the divorce We want to help kids that are struggling because of family situations I feel her pain that she has to set back and let the parents be sometime all we can do is just be there for them when they need somoene to just talk too I liked how Deb Sullivan called her garden her friend and how she compared the twin nephews and the garden on how they were the same Like when she was saying that she planted them in her world build a fence around them to keep them safe and how she has weed out their negatives out of their lives You can very clearly see how much she lovs Jake and Ben 

45	When I finished reading this essay I think the whole story relates to how John Hockenberry talks of places such as the Virginia Theatre and public restrooms and how those in wheelchairs or others who are handicapped are treated unfairly Why not put in a ramp at the theatre This is a question I thought of when reading this The part with the bottle of urine I found to be unusual I also find I think the reason for this is because the public restrooms make no room and doesn t seem like they try to hard to accomplish a restroom for people who are handicapped in wheelchairs or otherwise The author grabs me from the getgo The high price of pay for handicapped people in wheelchairs the usher being very rude This really was getting me upset and angry I can just imagine how he must of felt I think people in wheelchairs are still human and need even more respect because to no fault of their own noone asks to be in a wheelchair or otherwise If possible people need to be kind and generous and treat them with utter respect Can you tell This story got my blood boiling because of the way in him being unfairly from my point of view The part of the two attendants throwing him out of his wheelchair really is out of proportion It isn t right that he was going to dump his urine here He could have went home but maybe he needed to so he could use it again All in all the story just got me upset with the handicapped being treated unfairly in every respect 

45	I can relate to this story I like the part how Deb Sullivan refer to her Garden as a friend I think this is because she sees it as her place of sanity and finds peace and feels free being in her garden The story continues with her raking up leaves and then talk of thinking of nurture of animals humans and plants in her garden She goes into detail of how people tell her that her husand and herself would make great parents and then how they can t have children They have thought of adoption but that gets nowhere and the years continue to slip away Deb Sullivan then has a focus of her nephews Ben and Jake They are fifteen years old and identical twins She loved them from the start with a deep passion Probably because this is where she felt closest to someone when not being able to have any children of her own They created good memories going camping boating and more Tragedy strikes with the parents of these boys getting divorced and everything changes From Deb Sullivans point these boys now have a shattered life They have been forced prematurely into adulthood She finds she has tears on her face from a cool breeze drifting by and wipes her face Her attention turns back to the garden when she wipes dirt from her face from the tears She talks of planting Jake and Ben in her Garden wanting nothing more than to keep them safe and nurture them tenderly and to keep them safe from the harsh elements of life She realizes she has helped these boys by spending time with them and so refers to it as planting a seed in their lives She will continue to pray for them and in hope that the seeds of love she has sown will flourish in their lives She has helped to weed out the negatives in their life and also has helped them to make right choices She now stands back to watch them grow and turns to her garden to her peaceful and quite place that gives her comfort where she can be free from the worries of life This was a great story and in my own life with being divorced with two girls I watched the pain on their face also In the end it now worked out better all the way around I never say anything bad of their dad and I tell them it is not their fault They are enjoying time with him now I know they love me also and I do feel he does the same Letting them know I love them and it is not their fault I spent time in my own garden when I was married so this story is great I wouldn t change any of it I think she did the perfect job writing this essay and she just kept grabbing my attention with everything that I ve written She makes great points of her garden and the divorce 

45	This essay caught my attention with the title but that is about where it ended for me I found it a little hard to follow and the point escaped me in the beginning And why was he carrying a bottle of urine He never did explain that Or maybe I m just missing it I did feel sympathetic towards him when he mentioned the ill treatment that he received just because of his disability I wanted to smack the house manager that kicked him out so rudely But all in all I wasn t that thrilled with this story Aside from feeling a little indignant with the author I wasn t left with much of an impression with this essay 

45	I was captured by the title but that is about where it ended for me I found it a little hard to follow and the point escaped me in the beginning And why was he carrying a bottle of urine He never did explain that Or maybe I m just missing it I did feel sympathetic towards him when he mentioned the ill treatment that he received just because of his disability I wanted to smack the house manager that kicked him out so rudely But all in all I wasn t that thrilled with this story Aside from feeling a little indignant with the author I wasn t left with much of an impression with this essay 

45	This writer came off to me as being very judgemental and negative but I realize after reading it a couple of times she was basically stating her thoughts and observations as to how people act I do agree everyone does show off in some way or another but this doesn t make them a bad person at all it s just how we are we all just want to be noticed in some way I like how she states the different kinds of show offs and give examples of them it creates images for the reader 

45	I really liked this essay it kind of gives the reader a easy happy feeling Growing up she was a happy little girl that enjoyed how she lived it wasn t because of money either it was because her family worked together and supported eachother she worked for the things she got and it was a feeling of accomplishment to her After reading this essay it didn t make me wish I had more it made me wish that I had what she did I have lots of respect for people who work for what they get 

45	Chief Seattle uses one major tone though out the essay that he writes on the white man vs the red man or another term that he uses is his people The tone that I am refering to is that of a very deep intensived process that his people go through with the white people Chief Seattle uses many examples of this treatment through out his writing of this essay but the one example of this use of tone that sticks out to me in his writing is The white man s God cannot love our people or He would protect them To me this is his way of getting back at the white man for all that we have done to his people To me it is not the current peoples fault of what are ansestor did or didn t do to the red man or in the case of Chief Seattle his people It is not like he owns them In that way he is telling them what to do instead of letting them make up there own oppions on the white man and how we treat them The major techique that he uses through out this essay is the way that he words things so that when you read it the reader gets the sense that the blame is on the white people if he is of a different background and this inside of it s self can cause problems if you go back in to history If the reader is of white hertige this essay can make them feel like everything that they have no control on is all there fault when in reality they may have nothing but their heritige to do with it 

45	I feel the tone to the What Me Showing Off essay is obnoxious in most parts and the only humor I found is where she talked of herself showing off with her poems being published and she wanted everyone to know it The technique I find Viorst using is a lot to do with repetition There are many examples throughout the essay that explains this For example showing off is mentioned throughout the whole essay Viorst talks also about the different categories of showoffs which are the competive showoffs as well as the Narcissitic and sympathetic type showoffs She uses the word exhulting numerous times such as Exhulting is what my husband does when he cooks me one of his cheese and scallion omelets and pratically does a tap dance as he carries it from the kitchen stove to the table setting it before me with the purely objective assessment that this may be the greatest omelet ever created I feel the repition is distracting 

45	Mealtimes in my family have been a time when I usually cooked I was raised by my mother and grew up as a single child Many times especially in the summer it was my job to cook dinner because my mother would work We would have to have everything done in time for me to get to hockey practice I found our meals to be very rushed if I was to have any dinner around 5 00p m or 6 00p m at all Alot of times I would have to wait until after hockey practice to have dinner and then we usually picked up something from a fast food place 

45	Thoughts on We May Be Brothers This essay brought me to two different spots At the beginning the author led me to believe that he was only pointing out the differences between the two peoples and their ways of life I was not excited to read on at that point After continuing to read I really got sucked in by the way of thinking that this man had about the differences in the two peoples I really like how it ended by expressing how the two peoples differ in their view of death and how he the author believes that his people will always be around even if they are dead His writing gave me a very ominous feeling 

45	Stacy as writer comes out to me as a very loving and appreciative of her past She tells this essay from a single point of view She tells us of her past through child like eyes but through an adult voice She gave these examples through a paragraph like this Most nights my dad could finish the milking and catch up to us before we made it past the garden and carry the jug for us teasing us all the way By the time we got to the trailer and Dad had washed up we would have supper on the table and a large cool glass of milk setting at each place 

45	Collectively our group felt that Chief Seattle spoke in a reserved tone Reading his words you see the contrast between Chief Seattle s people My people are few and the Big Chief at Washington s people His people are many These are statements facts without emotion passive He uses powerful imagery throughout like day and night cannot dwell together Even though the title is We May Be Brothers by his question how then can we be brothers and all the other differences I wonder if he was saying here that it would be impossible 

45	This essay is about just that clutter Each day we deal with clutter Our children our jobs our belongings cars every day I deal with this clutter I love how he used clutter in different manners such as a laborious phrase language ponderous euphemism each time using it to the best of his ability 

45	Thoughts on What Me Showing Off This essay drips with truth The writer uses a sarcastic honest tone in writing this essay She displays her sarcastic tone and honesty in describing how she herself shows off And then there was us complaining about how tired we are today because we went to work rushed back to see our son s school play shopped at the market and hurried home in order to cook gourmet and then needlepointed another dining room chair And what we are doing is showing off Viorst is also uses humor in her writing She displays this by titling the different categories of showoffs as competitive showoffs CSO narcissistic showoffs NSO and insecure showoffs ISO I think that we all know at least one person who could fit in one or more of these categories More importantly it makes me wonder which one I would fit into 

45	Stacy Jurgens the author of Picnics and milk used a delightful tone throughout her essay Making sure that the mood is light and carefree coming from a child s eyes is a perfect setting I think The technique she uses is memories of childhood And I mean this as she allows you to see this essay through the memories of one child s childhood A perfect example of this specific technique is this Lunchtime was different then suppertime in that my father did not come back to the house to eat Instead he either took a lunch with him or my favorite in other words this was a childhood memory of hers that she can remember we took a picnic lunch to him We never knew when these picnics would occur but sometimes Mom would pull out the old wicker picnic basket and send us girls to the garden for fresh tomatoes and cucumbers We knew then that we were going to find Dad in the fields This was to me what seems to be a perfect memory for a child to recollect when they see a picnic basket or tomotoes and cucumbers I for one know this for sure I have had a lot of childhood memories and this girl sure knows what a memory can mean by the looks of particular objects or places 

45	I don t know if anyone will even come here anymore but I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone This was the first and probably the last class that I genuinely looked forward to coming to And not just because I love to write everyone was so nice too So thanks for the good memories See ya around Bethany 

45	Many years ago I had a girlfriend that was the love of my life I thought that we would always be together no matter what This girlfriend and I had a relationship for five years and we were very committed to one another Eventually I ended up taking a job in St Paul and because of this I was forced to move Our relationship continued for many months after but it was very hard We only got to see each other on the weekends so we always made the most of it We would go shopping and out to eat all the time On many of these ocassions I purchased things for my new apartment I still have many of them to this day One such purchase was a hollowed out clay cowboy boot my girlfriend helped me find the right fake flower arrangement to put inside I still think of her everytime I look at it I can still picture her arranging the flowers 

45	I feel that capital punishment is a way of families seeking revenge on an assailant I feel this way because of my christian beliefs It says in the Ten Commandments that to kill is a sin and that this sin is punishable by eternal damnation in hell I do believe this but I also believe that families do deserve some redemption I would have to say that killing someone for their satisfaction is wrong no matter who pushes the switch I would sooner have a criminal that deserve such a sentence be left to rot in a labor prision Atleast this way society could profit from their work and they would have no hope of ever getting out 

45	The human race can be so cruel People are criticised and rejected because they may be different or not normal When you see a person that may have special needs or maybe they talk differently we tend to tune them out and not acnowlege them I see people all the time doing this because i work with a child that has mental dissabilities THis child also has a hard time in social experiences When she meets new people she tends to latch on to them and thinks that everyone is her best friend SHe doesn t see the looks that some people make at her I hope that never changes She doesn t need to see them at her age she does not know how to discriminate She will play with those older than her and those younger than her I wish that no one could make someone feel differently We are all the same and we are all different WHat makes the difference is how we treat others and how we treat our selves When a person cannot respect their own self then there is no way that they can care about or even respect another person When i was about 13 years old I was teased and ridiculed I always was the but of anyones jokes and was not really liked be anyone I had a very good friend though that has kept me from continuing this disrespect They taught me that the people that had made fun of me jsut felt insecure about themselves so they teased me to make themselves feel better I hopethat someday this child that i take care of can see that it is not right to make fun of someone else jsut because they are unhappy with their lives I hope that maybe people will be able to see her for the sweet caring and talented young lady that she is becoming and not discriminater against her John Hockenberry s Essay Limited Seating on Broadway stated it best It is the forum and agent for chalenging America s hardend perceptions about race politics class gender religion and more recently AIDS and homophobia All of these people are are all different from us but they are also the same We need to remember that

45	When I married my husband I knew that both he and his father were trappers hunters and fisherman I was never exposed to these activities as a child because I was raised as a city kid The fishing I have come to enjoy and I can deal with the hunting as long as I don t have to carry a gun but the trapping is another story I can certainly relate with the author of The Coon Hunt as she described how she felt when she was expected to kill something for the first time She stated Oh no I am going to have to kill a raccoon How am I supposed to tell Dad that I can t kill anything My heart broke for her Her family was forcing her to except something she did not believe in I didn t have to think about hunting fishing and trapping much until our children started to get old enough to be interested in these activities I encouraged their love of fishing and when they were old enough even hunting as long as they hunted with respect for the animals But somehow I could never understand why they had to be part of the whole trapping experience To trap an animal and let it suffer until you return the next day or even a couple of days later is deplorable to me I knew that it was not just my decision so my husband and I compromised The kids could accompany him when he was setting traps but I did not want them to go along when he was actually collecting his catch or skinning or fleshing them in order to be sold For awhile this compromise worked nicely until grandpa got involved One day grandma and grandpa my husband s parents were babysitting our children When we returned home and pulled into their driveway I was shocked at what I saw Grandpa had been out in his trapping garage taking care of his catch for the day He had to skin and flesh the hides of the animals that he had trapped in order to prepare them to be sold He decided that our boys could accompany him to watch I guess one thing led to another and when we pulled in the driveway they had a beaver s intestines stretched from one end of the yard to another Needless to say I was appalled Somehow what they were doing was so disrespectful and disgusting to me Lives should be cherished even if they are only an animal s life When I got out of the car and asked what on earth they were doing Both of our boys simply replied We wanted to see how long they are I was speechless I asked my husband to please get the boys ready to go and I headed into the house to collect their things Once we returned home I sat the boys down and explained how I felt about what they were doing and why They had only been following their grandfather s lead and were too young to understand that what they were doing was wrong as far as I was concerned I explained to them that even though something is dead we still need to respect their remains I later discussed my feelings with my father in law He could not understand how I felt but agreed to make sure that the boys would never partake in something so gruesome again In exchange I agreed that when they were older enough they could make their own decision as to whether they were interested in trapping I appreciated the respect he showed for my feelings Interestingly enough neither one of our boys ever became truly interested in trapping as they grew up Was it because I felt so strongly about what had happened that day Was it the compromise my husband and I had reached Or was it because they too felt that trapping was an inhumane sport to participate in

16	Hello This is my BLOG Nothing special and it was meant to be that way For those of you who visit hope you gain something The main reason for this BLOG is because I dont have time to keep a journal mainly too lazy and journals aren t what I spend my time doing as in I spend alot of time on the computer and enjoy it so it makes sense that here is where I would keep a journal I enjoy order but I love chaos especially when its my doing Those who know me wouldn t mention that and maybe they dont pay attention to that detail but its a vital part of me I love many things in life and respect alot of other aspects of it such as my G F she means the world to me but her parents are very strict I respect that they dont want her and I to be together or around each other or having fun with each other but I do contradict that through being around her and trying to be some type of B F to her Overall I think I am a very nice out going guy I do have bad aspects like everyone although for the most part I try to be a person others would like to themselves after in my character I look at myself to be very chivilarous and also extremely involved with my studies outside of school and also my friends lives Now anyone who knows me should know that few people get to be my Friends and i make it this way because of trust you see it is very important to me that I have a circle of people that can be trusted rather than just have fun with but thats not to say I dont have aquintances I dont enjoy being around for the most part though I try to limit the amount of people who really know me for who I am 

33	Sunday was Father s Day and we geared up for a fantabulous day outside It was perfect weather 80 degrees bright blue sky and we had a terrific day planned Just before we left I read my mother s Father s Day sermon which was eloquent and sweet and moved me to tears check it out at http reverendpat blogspot com She wrote of her Uncle Ernie and revealed more about him to her congregation than she s ever shared with me personally My mother s family all died before my brother and I ever came on the scene except for Ernie who we only met once and they all carry this mythical mystique I only know them in stories that are pieced together that don t form cohesive wholes And since I only know them through my mother s eyes I always wonder what I would have seen or which of their personalities I would have encountered For as with any mysterious character they all have glamorous qualities scary dark ones and lots of shadows Uncle Ernie used to send us cards on our birthdays Cards with crisp new bills in them Usually a dollar but I remember getting 5 He never wrote notes and there was never news Just the new money and Love Uncle Ernie It was like magic for me getting those cards on my birthday Like getting a gift from the beyond almost He was such a ghost to me in many ways When I met him I was 13 and there s really no way for me to describe what it was like I suppose I had all these dreams and fantasies in my heart about what he meant to me and how much I thought he was this magical leprechaun kind of creature And since I was extremely shy and extraordinarily self conscious at 13 I had no way to really express any of that to him So I mumbled and looked at my feet and ran off to play as soon as I could and felt entirely trapped by my age and awkwardness And it was strange to meet him face to face like seeing a unicorn almost In a way it wasn t supposed to happen I can only hope he enjoyed it I know I did but I ll always feel as though I wasn t quite good enough And that he would see I didn t deserve all those nice cards he sent My Mom s sermon is about Uncle Ernie being an extraordinarily kind man And let me share with you this quote Spirituality is often about doing the tiny work of God little acts small responses to God s presence in our lives Spiritual people are about tiny things which is the fruit of their spirituality The spiritual life is not a life of success it is a life of faithfulness God does big things once in a while but there is no question that the primary work of God in the world is tiny God knew we would naturally be dazzled by big That s why Jesus told the parables of the lost sheep the lost coin the lost son the mustard seed The small seemingly insignificant acts we do in the name of Jesus Christ don t seem very impressive to us but they can make a big difference in people s lives Acts of habitual kindness can generate stability unity and wholeness in a community And to my mother Uncle Ernie her father figure embodied this spirituality This got me thinking of course And since I pride myself on being the kind of person who is kind to strangers I start to feel pretty darn good about myself and about how indeed I am a spiritual person living out my faith in small measure Yes sirree I m just small enough to be relevant to God So Mikie has a soccer game on Father s Day and since he loves to play soccer Collin and I happily join him Luckily he was playing at a field that has a playground attached So Collin and I set up camp at the playground while Mikie plays soccer When I say we happily join him let me clarify that this is a choice I make for Father s Day Honestly the idea of keeping Collin entertained at the park for 2 hours during his nap time is not that exciting of a prospect And had it been an ordinary Sunday I would have sent Mikie off to play while Collin napped at home But since it was Father s Day and luckily a gorgeous day we joined Mikie And quite frankly in spite of it all I m glad we did and I would do it again But it s important to note that I am just a little frazzled and anxious at how it s all going to go So no sooner than we arrive and Collin heads up the stairs to the Slide Slide Slide do we meet Roman Roman is 7 well he ll be 7 in just 3 months 3 months is his math he ll actually be 7 in 2 months August 31 to be precise Roman is a talker At first we merely exchange pleasantries he actually says Good afternoon which is charming We go over all our names He has me guess both his middle name and his last name He then wants to guess mine and Collin s names Then he wants me to guess his nickname then he wants to guess our nicknames Then he just wants to chat Well it s a nice day and he seems a little like a lost soul they always know where to find me so we strike up a chat Except also remember I have a responsibility to Collin who is busy on new playground equipment so I m sort of torn between the two of them I m getting a glimpse at what it s like to have two kids and it scares the hell out of me And then Roman just keeps talking And talking and talking and talking I m wondering to myself where this kid s parents are and I start looking around He eventually tells me he s there with his grandma who is busily chatting away with one of her friends on a park bench And I am torn between the desire to be God s servant and the desire to tell this kid to shut up so I can enjoy my own child I take deep breaths focus in on Collin and remember a challenge from my mother s sermon Listen to the neighbor kid s troubles instead of saying Get lost Usually giving our life to Christ isn t glorious It s done in all those little acts of love 25 cents at at time I resolve myself to be good and ask more probing questions I come to discover that Roman has 1 sister and 2 brothers all of whom live in Ukraine So who do you live with here I ask THAT is not a good question he replies with all the 7 year old seriousness he can muster So I learn even more about Roman while Collin is looking around wondering where his mother is and why she s talking to this kid instead of sliding Roman s had it kind of rough He s trying out his third Dad The first one was greedy and the second one was mean and bad This one is OK but he s the laziest according to Roman There are stories of abuse and stories of neglect It s obvious the kid carries a painful load And to help him cope I guess he talks And talks and talks And I spend a good deal of time really investing in Roman encouraging him asking for details telling him he s great and smart and a very mature kid He apologizes for having to say a bad word But he just has to use the word stupid Again he apologizes after he says it But it is just stupid that the community center wants to charge 72 for only 15 basketball games when swimming is free I told him it was OK to use stupid in that context and that I agreed with him I also told him I appreciated that he s very careful about that bad word And then I had several ooey gooey moments where I looked lovingly out at the soccer field and at my sweet Collin and said Amens and Hallelujahs that my life is so much more simple than poor dear Roman s I started to feel as though Roman was there for me as a little kick start of gratitude Stop your whining and anxiousness and give thanks that Collin only has one Dad who is neither greedy mean bad or lazy And if Collin wants to play basketball stupid or not we d easily pay the money So I had nothing but misty eyes for Roman for a while And Collin was enjoying his company And really it was so nice out It was turning out to be quite a good day And then Roman just kept talking and Collin was getting more demanding Collin needed to eat but he was all dirty so trying to clean him and offer him food that he would eat and all that jazz while Roman was busy chatting away was distracting and nerve producing It was hard to interrupt Roman and speak to Collin I mean I wanted to be present to this poor kid and make him feel special But at the expense of my own sanity and my own kid It started to get a little tricky Where was this grandmother anyway And there were plenty of other people at the park couldn t someone else entertain Roman for a while Once Collin downed his sand covered banana and his energy was restored for more exploring we headed back to the jungle gym and Roman began to recount to me all the details of the SERIES of books his teacher read to them this year And you know 7 year olds are not the best story tellers So Annie she s King Arthur s sister You know King Arthur Well she s King Arthur s sister Well King Arthur s sister s sister And she um Annie the sister she has a friend Jack And Annie her sister King Arthur s sister s sister she made this house This magic treehouse And when they want to come back they just get in and it spins and spins and then there they are And this one time Annie she went to the dinosaur times And on and on My head is now officially aching and I m getting angry at this kid for wasting my time and distracting me with this drivel Then I remembered something I read recently from Pamela Anderson in Jane magazine She talks about positive energy and surrounding yourself with positive energy And paying attention to the people you re with do they give you positive energy or are they energy vampires And it hits me like a ton of bricks that Roman is an energy vampire I m giving all my energy away to this little blood sucker and I m so stressed and frustrated about it that I m cranky and miserable And totally unavailable for my child and husband I m giving all of myself away to this stranger who is draining me so I m now empty for Mike and Collin It seems like the only thing to do is to just distance from Roman to start ignoring him and paying more attention to Collin So Collin and I go down the slide together which delights him so we do it again and again and again Roman sensing my separation now asks for me to play tennis with him I explain that I need to keep a closer eye on Collin and he still persists we can play in the grass he says pleadingly Those innocent eyes looking so hopeful I apologize and keep sliding with Collin The guilt is nagging at me I m having internal wars about whose religion I m going to follow my mother s or Pamela Anderson s The choice seems strangely ironic to me as they both seem utterly opposite and utterly attractive at the same time Where the hell is his grandmother Occasionally she comes over and speaks to him in hushed not so friendly Ukrainian But for the most part she has left him to me I start to wonder if she always does this He did say he s at this park every day He explains to me that he forgot the popsicles and that he s really upset because they are going to be here all day and it s so hot out This is when I realize Roman is not going anywhere soon I m still dancing between ignoring him and playing with him when he starts to ask me to reach a tree branch for him so he can climb the tree I tell him I can t and suggest he ask his grandma to do it He won t do that I realize of course he wants me to do something for him that he shouldn t do so I say I won t and sorry and all that jazz There is a tornado of guilt and obligation and woe and empathy and frustration and hatred inside me I keep trying to breathe deeply and appreciate the blue sky and the nice shade of the park but it s no use My anxious insides are wearing me out What would Uncle Ernie do I wonder I know the answer of course and I feel I ve failed him once again The whistle finally blows to stop the game and I scoop Collin up announce that we re leaving say a quick and kind good bye to Roman and march off to the field for some relief in Mikie And wouldn t you know as we re leaving the field heading for the car who is heading home from the park Roman with Grandma in tow He wants to know which way we are walking maybe we could join them We re going in the car I say we live far from here Oh he says with obvious disappointment And while I said pleasant good byes and was as nice as I was able I can t help but feel I let him down People are always letting Roman down I guess In the end I didn t really choose either religion Just my often practiced and ever faithful tension and anxiety And the hope that I ll be out of this situation as soon as possible 

33	We had the pleasure this week of experiencing our neighborhood pool We are fortunate enough to live in the Chicago area where people take summer seriously We ve been indoors all winter and we get outdoors all summer The city is bursting with fun and exciting things to do Our neighborhood pool is basically a water park Water playground is its official name and man they ain t kidding This place is awesome They have a super huge pool with lots of shallow water 2 HUGE inner tube water slides for the big kids and a groovy little play area for the small ones We naturally were in the groovy little area for the small ones Imagine a huge climbing structure in the middle of a shallow pool with a zillion little fountains and things At the top are two different water slides which we can go on with Collin At the very top of the structure is one of those giant buckets that fills with water and periodically splashes down on the entire area with tremendous force OK so that s what it is Now let me tell you that last night we went to the pool after Collin s nap we arrived about 5 00pm Let me also tell you that it is mid June Being from Texas mid June is HOT Chicago has slightly cooler weather and we were a little nervous to arrive at the pool and find it not quite warm out but not quite cold either We try to divert Collin s attention with hanging out in the warmish shallow end of the giant beach like pool Neither of us was really into getting truly wet But he wanted to head for the slides so we followed him over there Let me tell you that water is COLD Like teeth chattering cold This did not deter our son however and he started for the slides right away In order to do that he of course had to climb up through all the cold spraying water And since he s 20 months old we decided parental supervision was in order OK that s the setup here s the pitch You know how when you re faced with something cold splashing on you you brace yourself duck for cover and do whatever you can to cover yourself from the water Well my instincts were right on the money and I did just that Except what I used to cover myself from all this splashing was Collin I didn t really realize it until we got to the top of the stairs and he is sputtering and shaking and trying to get the water off of his face It was one of those brilliant parenting moments let me tell you Fortunately it didn t seem to bother him much and I made adjustments We went down the slide again and again Poor Collin was shaking and his little teeth were chattering but his smile never faded And Mikie and I freezing and shivering ourselves had one of those united front parenting moments I just love I turned to him and said You know this is one of those times when you know just how much you love your kid His chipper response That s right we can t ruin his fun And I just smiled at this amazing man so appreciative of the tremendous effort he and I were happily making for our boy

33	So my husband is a bit of a Star Wars freak Not the dress up as a character and go to conventions kind although he has been to a convention or two but worse than that he is the collecting kind Oh yes you read that right He collects Star Wars stuff He has a room a Star Wars room of all things And it s filled with toys and books and comics and posters and various other Star Wars merchandise An entire wall filled with toys in pristine condition from all the new movies Oh sure he has stuff from the olden days stuff his parents weren t smart enough to throw away he would say they were smart enough NOT to throw it away but mostly he has the new stuff I m not quite sure where this collecting addiction stems from but he s got it bad And of course he s kind of a snob about it so you can t really get him anything He s got this bizarre and mysterious criteria for what s cool that only he knows He started collecting when the re releases happened He was fresh out of college and flush with Wall Street cash and before you could say May the Force be with you his passion for the movies became a passion for collecting Now where do I fit in to all of this I began to see early on that this childish joy was so pure that I really didn t want to be the mean old witch getting in the way of things so I decided to accept it lovingly Wasn t that nice of me I assumed it wouldn t last forever Well it s gone on way longer than expected and quite frankly he should be lucky the house is big enough and we don t need that room Of course I have days when I wonder Hey what about my room I suggested painting the the laundry room pink and making it all girly just for me but then that depressed me I d really rather not hang out there thank you very much Anyway my husband has this R2D2 robot that he got from his parents last Christmas Yes they still purchase toys for their son even though he s in his 30 s Trust me they too think it is weird but they are those wonderful super love kind of parents who would do nothing to stand in the way of their son s happiness That and really what the hell else is there to get And now he is using this Star Wars character robot with our son 20 month old Collin Well not surprisingly Collin thinks it is really cool And I think they are adorable the three of them playing together Mikie giving commands R2 making these weird electronic noises and Collin doing his happy dance But when Mikie isn t at home Collin points at the thing and says R2 R2 and looks at me expectantly wanting me to give it commands to make it dance and sing those mechanical songs Well I don t know how the thing works and to be frank I don t really want to know Knowing sends me much farther down the Star Wars path than I am willing to go And really now don t you think I m far enough already Remember the room people But when that sweet boy starts to get frustrated and throw a terrible two tantrum over it yes he is ahead of his age thank you for noticing I wonder if it s worth it just to know a few things But then I remember diversion and Collin and I play with good old fashioned wooden puzzles instead And then we ll read some books or sing some songs I ll let Daddy be the one to teach him all about Star Wars I ll let it be their little bonding thing Just look for me in the rosy pink laundry room 

33	We recently enjoyed a visit from the MIL and she requested we go to Ravinia one night Since Mikie and I both LOVE Ravinia we were happy to oblige Ravinia for those of you who don t know is one of Chicago s most impressive treasures Ravinia is a place a state of mind an event a world all into itself Basically from Memorial Day to Labor Day Ravinia an outdoor music arena hosts a variety of concerts from jazz to pop to classical As it is the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra classical is the predominant musical medium We decided to attend Saturday night s concert This season the symphony is featuring the works of Rachmaninoff and we were thrilled to learn that Saturday night the symphony would play Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini I m no classical snob I basically like the stuff I ve heard before I enjoy all types of classical but the songs I love are the ones that are familiar tunes Usually made familiar by commercials and elevator music So I was thrilled when I learned that I would actually know some of the music Not only that I do love that Rhapsody on a Theme You know the one It goes like this Da da da da dum Da da da Dum Da da da da dum La da da dum And on and on Typically an evening at Ravinia is one of elegant sophistication and romance It s a giant picnic under the stars where people bring fancy little tables and place settings everyone sets up candles has wine and cheese and gourmet snacks Presentation matters The woman at the table next to us brought a hurricane lamp and surrounded it with fresh flowers This gives you an idea of the lengths people go to to make this a special occasion And it is special magical even There s nothing quite like live classical music played by a world class symphony But instead of being crammed in an uncomfortable seat wearing shoes that are too tight you are in your most comfortable yet stylish outfit lying on your back looking at the stars OK so imagine a 21 month old thrown into the mix whose bedtime is right around the start of the show Wondering how this is going to go So were we On the drive up we had lots of conversations about setting expectations I made it clear that we shouldn t force Collin to do anything That if we let him drive the bus in terms of walking standing sitting strolling whatever it would keep him quiet and happy and we would all enjoy the evening much better Quiet is important at Ravinia There s no talking during the performance They even have noise police in khaki pants and Ravinia golf shirts walking around with signs asking people to be quiet So we were a little on edge about keeping Collin quiet And of course we can feel the tension of the people around us wondering when this toddler was going to explode and ruin their Ravinia experience Well he did make a noise But he only endeared himself to his fellow music lovers when he did it You know how in a big symphonic piece there is a slight pause between movements A hush so you can linger in the last moment of the first section before they thrill you with the next Well it was during this hush that Collin broke into applause and shouted Yay We were the proud recipients of many warm giggles and stares after that For the most part Collin decided that Ravinia is best enjoyed on foot He circled the entire complex several times and we spent countless minutes going over the same steps and ramps and trips to see the train and the potty As there were three adults there it was just perfect One adult was always up and completely focused on Collin his ideal And then two were left to enjoy each other s company back at our base camp of our blanket chairs snacks and bottles of wine I don t mind admitting that sometimes when I m on Collin duty it feels much more like a chore than play Especially when it s the weekend and I feel stuck doing the job I do all week It s just like if you had to go into the office on a Saturday I can t explain why I have that feeling and I wish I didn t but I do But not at Ravinia I m not sure if it was the music or the wine probably a little of both but we both had the most amazing time Collin was running around in his pajamas we had brief delusions that he would go night night under the stars looking like the happiest kid on the planet and he easily switched partners when one of us needed a break and never lost his happy grin I was off duty when the Rhapsody came on and I thought we made a mistake I didn t see how this song would eventually become the famous tune I was hoping to hear And then gradually I began to hear that it might and I was switching over to Collin duty when it started Well I was in heaven Collin and I danced in circles to the music I couldn t contain myself It was the most exciting and glorious sound I had ever heard My feet HAD to dance And I was glad to have Collin in my arms both because I love him so much and because he gave me full permission to be as bold of a dancer as possible Had I not been with Collin I might have danced anyway and that would be the thing that inspired Mr D to start his own blog When certain music plays that leads me to dance it s as though it is the natural extension of the swells in my heart Classical music always makes me yearn for the stage And Collin giggled and twirled right along with me Still too young to roll his eyes and be embarrassed by his mother Rather he was looking at me with pure adoration After our big number we headed over to the stairs where we played with Isaac He had one of those be careful Moms and I felt sorry for her Collin and I had a ball playing with her child and she was so anxious and self conscious that she couldn t really let go and have fun He just gloms on to people she said in an exasperated and apologetic tone That s fine How cute I yelled back as I chased both boys back up the ramp I could have played with them all night but she was getting uncomfortable to her credit she was pregnant and I forgive a pregnant lady for anything and Collin was ready to move to the next big thing The train Collin has a passion these days for trains And the Metra Chicago s commuter railway has a stop right at the Ravinia gates So wouldn t you know it just after we left Isaac and his Mom and we were near the front gate I saw that the Ravinia staff was preparing for the arrival of the train So Collin and I parked ourselves behind a fence and waited for the train to arrive Here it comes here it comes he kept saying Oooohhhh a train A train he shouted over and over as it pulled into the station looking at me as if he couldn t believe his luck Bye bye train Bye bye train he said and waved as it left With a twinkle in his eye he shared with me a conspiratorial smile as if just the two of us had seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow Next we were off to the potty one of Collin s other new passions We re potty training in full force now But this trip Collin didn t want to go potty himself No he just hung around with me in the stall occupying himself with all the delights of the toilet paper and flushing and the little trash can I started our adventure in the stall by getting out a liner for the bowl Just as I was about to put it on the seat I thought better of it and decided to give that one to Collin to play with undress a little bit then put mine on the seat and pull down sit down in one swift motion so he wouldn t steal my liner Well wouldn t you know he took the liner and placed it perfectly on the seat just like my own personal potty valet And then he quietly amused himself with toilet paper which he then handed me when I was ready I was beside myself with the bounty of my good fortune It s not that Collin isn t a good kid he s actually a really good kid But keep in mind it is about 9 30pm and he is still in excellent spirits and blissfully happy and well behaved His Nannie as he calls his grandmother was on Collin duty when Mikie and I decided it was time to go We packed up our little site and looked out over the crowd searching for Collin and Nannie It was such a beautiful sight Silent reverence for the beautiful music candle light the twinkling of the stage lights in the distance 16 stars in the darkening sky We didn t spot Collin but sure enough when there was a pause from one movement to the next we heard his familiar Yay and those little hands clapping and we knew just where to go 

14	The teacher that I mentioned in the section about my friends is a weird story In grade 3 we had to read silently at the beginning of every day while listening to Backstreet Boys in the background I think whenever that wasn t playing she was singing kay sara sara On a daily basis she would klonk us on the head with a book if we ever said something stupid or did anything to annoy her She also yelled the whole 2nd floor and part of downstairs could hear her Sandy the teacher flipped out on me one day it was scary I was only like 8 then So I ran out screaming after my mommy wanted to know what was wrong I told her and she had a said she wanted to schedule an appointment for later My mommy found out that I hadn t done a lick of homework the first term and that I had a test to see if I was functioning properly My result came back saying I had the intelligence level of a grade 5 Still it was just hell after that I stayed up every night until I went to bed doing nothing but homework This teacher was a friggin drill sergeant Before the appointment my mommy was aware of all the things the teacher did to me and the other kids So she decided to take a recorder that could fit in her pocket Sandy spilled her guts for about an hour boy was she surprised when my mom pulled out the recorder and shut it off It was made so if we had any more problems with her she could be fired or held back from teaching That year I got all straight A s Sandy acted proud that I was in her class at the awards assembly She had no faith in me before the hypocrite even worse she said she helped me She did not what so ever So that s how it went and the next year was smooth in her class

16	As I strolled into the mall yesterday gently bypassing the group of about 10 8th grade well now freshmen girls who were congregating in front of the Electronics boutique I had a certain glimmer in my eye Madden 05 had just come out and I was about to purchase it However to my dismay the stiffs at EA Sports dellayed the release of the computer version of the popular video game until September 9th I was nearly in tears What game was I going to play when I got back to my house I went to J crew to try and think things off and got a nice tie there althought it wasn t the one I wanted and my short term memory sudenly kicked in I remembered that just a few hours earlier I had a red an article about this computer game about political campaigning It had seemed hilarious with the capabilities of pitting thomas jefferson against the guvanator I laughed whole heartedly Naturally at this point I felt the distinct need to buy it I rushed back to EB past the pack of gigling girls by now they had recognized me I pushed aside a small child not really but it makes it dramatic does it not and picked out the game From then on it was bliss In my first campaign I ran myself against the guvanator and lost But it was close I would have one if not for Ahnould s last minute grab of new york I even won Texas In my second game I possessed the poise and experience nesecairy to win it all I clobbered Barbara Bush She won Montana Colorodo and South Carolina That was it I finished with over 500 electoral votes and over 95 million popular votes I was trully the champion Today I will embark upon a campaign that features appearances on Night time with Fred Toppel The O maley Factor Hardhitter Barry King Live 60 Seconds and of course Barbara Sawyer The Political machine is simply a marvelous game and I recomend it to anybody whether interested in politcs or not To summarize 8th grade girls need to stop giggling whenever they see me EA Sports is a bunch of stifs and The Political Machine is the best game of all time not Madden 05 

16	The day we have all been waiting for has finally arrived Well sort of When trying to find out the release date of the Passion I came upon a marvelous discovery On Noveber the 22nd Seasons One Two and Three of SEINFELD will be available for purchase via DVD Words can not describe how happy I was to hear this I immediatly rank this day amoung my top five days of my life and I ve had some pretty good times There s simply no limit to the amound of good this has done in the world and quite frankly I m thinking of forgoing the entire 2nd half of the month of November in order to watch all the episodes Again and again 

16	First off let me say once and for all that Les Mis is far superior to Phantom of the Opera in every way Well not that any of you can tell but I ve been sitting here for about three minutes to try and come up with a second line so I supose I shall just move on Back to the Political Machine for those of you who went out and bought it good job I ve got a few funny characters i can send you if you so desire Namely Arlen Spector Rick Santorum Marvin the Martian Hitler Mckain JFK and im working on Osama In just a little while the ultimate showdown between Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden will begin At stake The American Presidecy The winner well either way we re screwed But it sounds really funny 

16	No one is happy relatively for a longer or shorter time You re happy or you re not That s all And death has nothing to do with it death is an accident of happiness in that case Albert Camus The above quote was pulled from Mr Camus first novel A Happy Death and to me it says alot It corellates well with my death is just another stage of life philosophy Camus recognizes that death is inevitable and should nt factor in to your hapines In other words one should not worry about death I wrote alot more on the subject but I thought it sounded stupid so I deleted it not that I don t recognize how stupid this post sounds anyway atleast there s a good quote Just haven t really had anything inspired to say since i ve been writting this limitations piece it seems to be taking up the wole good half of my brain Alas enjoy Mr Camus and go read all of his books which i will hencefourth rank in ascending order of goodness 1 The First Man a controversial choice due to its lesser noteriety but my favorite nonetheless 2 The Stranger His most critically acclaimed book a book which neithr I nor the man who works the counter at Barnes and Noble could figure out 3 The Plague Rusty s favorite think Nazis 4 A Happy Death his First Novel genuienly bizare many consider it his precursor to The Stranger 5 The Fall Still a Great book just without the certain flair that characterizes his other works 6 All of his other books which I have t read The Rebel The myth of the Sissyphus Calligula and three other plays I think he wrote some essays which have been published too and his notebooks have been published though i m not sure if they ve been published in English To summarize my thoughts on Camus I shall say that he was simply the best and its a horrible shame that he died before being able to grace us with more of his genious 

16	Ok so i ve got about a page worth of material so far on limations but I haven t yet actually hit the meat of my argument so I decided i ll just focus on writting it out much in the style of my Discourse on the Soph Hop and then I ll post it as an attachment with a breif summary in my blog It s coming along nicely a bit jambled I m horribly out of practice with my writting as you can undoubtebly tell but I do make some compelling points 

16	One thing i ve learned about this country in the aftermath of the McGreevey resignation which quite frankly shocks me is that 15 of mariages survive one partner admiting that they re gay 15 of maigiages do not end as a result of one partner coming out of the closet 15 of mariages continiue even though one partner is gay Pardon me for being a bit naive on the subject but what the hell I might be a bit judeo christian on this one but shouldn t people who are maried atleast be attracted to the sex of their partner I ve heard of loveless mariages but this statistic takes the cake I cannot fathom how someone can be maried to someone of the opposite or even the same sex unless they are attracted to that sex Talk about defending mariage I think it s time we called in Ricky boy on this one 

16	So I get home from work yesterday to find that I have two items from the mail The first being my monthly J Crew catalogue I quickly devowered while the second I had to think twice about It was a letter from a beloved beleagured president It was your standard campaign letter thanking me for my continiued support and asking for a charitable donation to the Bush Chenney foundaion I even got a cool W in 04 bumper sticker which i intend to place proudly somewhere at AFS take that liberal thesbians However I do find it rather interesting that I ve managed to slip onto their mailing list This is my second such letter who could forget the infamous George Laura autographed photo which is now resting proudly in my top drawer since the campaign has begun It is highly humorous to me because I am in no way a Republican and given almost any other man running under the democratic ticket I would endorse him and not Bush Secondly I am a minor and thusly it is illegal for me to contribute financially to their campaign The predominant thought as I hastilly compiled a letter telling them to stop asking me for money because I can t and won t give any was how in the heck was my name ever put on their list I m neither a wealthy buisnessman nor a Christian supremist living in the Midwest so why are the republicans interested in me Am I to asume that former socialists attending Quaker schools who have harshly critisized Bush in the past are prime candidates for Bush campaigners Is Republican logic so fundamentally flawwed that despite that fact they have nearly double he campaign money tha the democrats do they still need to heckle 16 y o s for chump change I mean even if I were to give them the minimun gift of 25 does that really make a difference considering they allready have over 250 million And to think this is the party i m endorsing for the upcoming election Where have you gone Bill Clinton Constitutional Amendment against gay mariage I think we need a Constitutional Amendment allowing presidents more than two terms 

16	Hey I ve been talking with a few people about the limitations of our world and the comparisons and teachings that we can glean from it So I decided to dedicate my next posting to the subject For now I will just leave you with this saying I thought of limitations are wraught from the human mind not the human condition I ll finish later Have fun with it 

16	There are a few old movies that I would like to give props to First and foremost my first ever movie Milo and Ottis Don t ask me what it s about I hav evnt the slightest of clues but being my first movie I thought I should mention it Secondly my second ever movie Aliens the 2nd one with the marines in it What a cool movie I mean come on Aliens marines cool space age guns what could be better I remember having dreams where I was in my grand parents house because thats where I d allways watch the movie and I would have one of those neato pulse action riffles from the movie and I d be running around killing aliens What a great movie so great in fact that I am seing Aliens Versus Predators on Friday What fun And Finally the mother of all movies Ghostbusters Simply a classic Whether it s the first or the second it all kicks ass They even had a computer game back when computers still hooked up to tv s Man was that a fun game you got to pick your car and your equip and run around the city fighting the stay puffed marshmellow man Alright those are my thoughts for the day no newspaper so no new anti Kerry rants That l be another day Adios 

16	Hey everyone This is my blog another product of my mindless days here at work In the upcoming days months etc I will be posting on a semi routine basis on topics such as new clothes i may have purchased the latest Red Sox quandry how much the Yankees suck Rick Santorum John Kerry The portrait of a dumbass George Bush The portrait of a dumber though should still be our president ass and anything else I feel like because well I can Hope you all enjoy I know at some point i m going to say something interesting on here l8er 

16	That s it after four days without going on a John Kerry rant I think it s about time to put shoty back in his place While visiting Grand Canyon with his wife John Kerry in typical fashion vowed to devote more money to our Fledgling Fedeeral Park system This idea was met with wide applause naturally seing as the audience were national park goers but I question the meaning behind this promise In typical election year fashion Kerry once again makes an empty promise that stirs up a fervor amoung potential voters In trademark style might as well give Kerry a flashy logo and stamp it on anything he says or does Kerry makes an appealing promise without any thought or true agenda behind it Kerry fails to realise or perhaps fails to adress the lofty financial responsibilities needed to validate such a promise and instead favors empty promises and purple hearts Americans need to wake up and realise that a man who voes against increasing funding for our troops in Iraq and yet in his acceptance speech promises to send in 40 000 more troops while also pledging that he has an exit plan though never actually telling the public what that it can never be a fiscally responsible president Kerry assails Bush for his record defecits and he s right in the past Bush has nt been fiscally responsible in any sense of the word However Kerry s economics do nothig to substntiate his claims that he is a more fiscally responsible president While Kerry promises to cut the federal defecit in half quicker another vague Kerry staple word then the Republicans He plans to do so while raising exspenses in several areas and cutting taxes in the middle class True he does plan to roll back tax cuts in the upper class but with the far greatr number of americans who would benefit from middle class tax cuts versus the number of americans who would be adversly affected by repealing Bush s tax cuts I question whether little to any new revenues would be gained from this endeaveur Kerry promises a brighter future but what he really wants is a brighter coloured house 

34	urlLink A nice surprise when I got home this past weekend from lake Tahoe urlLink 

34	This one was the nicest out of five hatchlings They all were smokin but this little guy was the prettiest 

34	Mitch Kupchak It s obvious that he is in over his head at this point in time Dr Buss feel free to call Jerry West up and apoligize to him for running him out of town to Memphis We need a real GM right now who has the experience Every passing day brings more and more bad news D Fish has opted out of his deal now Let s see I guess that leaves the glove Gary Payton and Deaven George on the team now even though Shaq is under contract I m not counting on him being around anymore because it s obvious he doesn t want to be Laker anymore Great that s just a fine nucleus of players NOT 

34	This makes all the sense in the world for the Clintons urlLink Drudge is quoting an unnamed top Kerry source saying that all the signs are pointing in that direction This is a scary development but one that if true in my opinion will only help solidify support for Bush Sure Hillary will energize the female vote etc but she will energize the GOP base like nothing else could This is a fascinating development in the campaign 

34	As i was going through the news today I am always struck when I hear democrats specifically Hillary at a San Francisco fundraiser for Barbara Boxer say that we need to recind the recent tax cuts for the common good Huh Excuse me urlLink Hillary but the money I earn is my money and not the federal governments money We are not under taxed in the US What an amazing story Also we handed sovereignty back to the Iraqis yesterday That was a great symbolic day for them if nothing else We all know that security is still going to be a problem for them over there but it was nice to see that we are keeping our word to them that we are not occupiers but liberators Their destiny is in their hands now I have mixed emotions about the Supreme Court s ruling that enemy combatants can now have access to the US Judical system On one hand everyone deserves to get their due process and day in court if accused of a crime but the people we have down at GITMO are not US citizens They are enemy combatants Are our soldiers now supposed to start reading the Miranda warning to all prisoners of war that we capture Hard questions I think the court has just muddied the waters 

34	I posted a comment a few days ago about the political futures market being a great predictor of future events and low and behold I found an article by none other than urlLink Larry Kudlow of Kudlow Kramer fame and also star economist and member of the Board of directors of the Club for Growth that articulates this alot better than I did Please take a look at the article from National Review 

34	Oh my how the double standard hypocracy wheel turns Get ready everyone for fireworks this week in the John Kerry Campaign It seems that what s good for the goose is good for the gander urlLink Drudge is reporting that the same media that demanded sealed divorce records from now former Republican Senate candidate Jack Ryan of Illinois are set to demand full release of John Kerry s very messy 1988 divorce For those that aren t familiar with the Jack Ryan details his divorce records say that his wife alledged that he wanted some form of sex in public at certain strip clubs Bill Clinton eat your heart out Your about to see a media feeding frenzy that doesn t happen all that often but when it does it is a sight to behold The only question I have is if the media will have the guts to actually follow through with this What a great start to the week 

34	Well I m back from an awesome three day weekend in Lake Tahoe Everything was perfect except I lost about 100 playing blackjack I want to give props to the Nelson Barnett and Hagemeyer families for putting on a wonderful event The scenery was beautiful friends family great and much more It looks like we will do this all again in three months when Katie Jonas say their I do s in Napa I m looking forward to that one too For anyone reading this wanting a great wedding reception place you couldn t do much better than Edgewood Country Club in Tahoe What a place I m out 

34	that show more of a Bush trend First we had urlLink Rasmussen with a 2 point Bush lead then urlLink Fox News with a six point Bush lead and last we had urlLink Gallup showing Bush with a big improvement over their last numbers If anyone out there has John Kerry s ear please tell him that his campaign is on life support 

34	I have a question for all you liberals out there I m putting a fund together to help urlLink Al Gore s family pay for the insane asylum How much can you guys pitch in It s obvious he has lost all touch with reality They might even just send him to some sort of anger management program to deal with his issues Between his and Howard Dean s speeches it s a wonder Kerry is even close right now John f ing Kerry has got to be cursing at himself right now and trying to figure out how to muzzle these idiots I say keep it up Al and Howard The more America sees these speeches the faster you ll slip into political oblivion 

34	As i m sitting here at my desk thinking of how we all can best honor Ronald Reagan I got it What if everyone took one Saturday a month out their busy schedule and volunteered for the local county Bush Cheney 2004 team from now until election time to help Bush across the finish line a winner It is going to take a huge effort to turn out our voters The RNC has put together what they call the 72 hour task force to mobilize voters during the last weekend before the Tuesday election We plan to put together the biggest get out the vote drive that has ever been undertaken by a campaign Everyone knows that the stakes couldn t be higher in November Everything from security taxes judgeships etc is on the table A few votes in a few swing states is going to make all the difference An added benefit is that working for the campaign is fun You get to meet all kinds of new people and make new friends with people of like mind 

34	Bad news for democrats urlLink new U S home sales leap to record high John Kerry et al can t be very happy about all these positive economic indicators lately I mean according to him we re in the worst economy since the Great Depression All this good news is just not good for them They were hoping to campaign on gloom and doom as always 

34	As the election gets closer and closer I am becoming even more optimistic about our chances to pick up some badly needed Senate seats so President Bush can get his judges confirmed I figure there will be at least two Supreme Court vacancies during the next Presidential term if not three It is very important to have a Republican Senate to break the democratic filibusters that they have been using urlLink John Thune is a great candidate He barely lost to Tim Johnson in an off year election in 2002 Tom Dascle has seen his best days already It s time to send him back to home to his real home in Washington D C not in South Dakota where he pretends to be conservative the closer the election gets Any donations for him would be greatly appreciated 

34	is a place called urlLink Refdesk Take a look at all the links on the page You literally can let your fingers do the walking as they say for any piece of info you need 

34	As if this guy s head wasn t any bigger Now word has come out that Benifer has won a World Poker Tour event here in Los Angeles at the Commerce Casino I don t need to hear about these stories I really don t care Dude is an egomaniac Nice to see that J Lo was really so heartbroken over him that she waited a whole four months to get remarried 

34	Yesterday at the polls This is exactly what the urlLink Club for Growth was formed to do It bundles financial support to pro growth free market conservatives over RINO candidates In the case of David Beasley of South Carolina though it was because of his protectionist views In the Utah 2nd district race John Swallow won the right for a rematch against Jim Matheson John lost a squeaker in 2002 and seems in good position to win this seat back He should get good coattails from Bush s upcoming winning margin in Utah 

34	Well I guess it s time to go on record about my illustrious urlLink UCLA Bruins for the upcoming season After all I did name my blog after them I m afraid this is the season we are going to hit rock bottom I really would like to believe that the glass is half full but after reviewing this years recruiting class player losses coaching quotient and a few other factors one can only come to the conclusion that this season is going to be an absolute train wreck They probably will be unwatchable If the gutty little bruins can scrape a victory over USC then I would classify that as a good season for them this year I m not getting my hopes up though 

34	It looks like based on today s latest poll that Jim Demint will defeat former governor David Beasley R SC in today s South Carolina Senate primary This is indeed good news Chalk up a win for the good guys Demint is a strong free market conservative He will have a great shot at capturing this open seat for the republicans in the fall 

34	Being the commodities futures broker that I am I believe that psychology is what drives the markets When people feel strongly about a market they wager money or trade on that information There are now exchanges to take action on political races One such place is called urlLink Intrade Right now based on current betting and trades urlLink George W Bush has a 58 of pulling out a victory in November This of course can change but right now the so called smart money is on Bush 

34	Once Al Qaeda followed through on their promise to murder their hostage My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims family of the South Korean gentleman Kudos to South Korea for not giving in to the terrorists This is another great reason to keep urlLink George W Bush as our commander in chief We need steady leadership during these hard times 

34	It s only late June and already I am getting poll fatigue Each day brings a new rollercoster ride known as modern scientific polling Today we saw urlLink The ABC Washington Post Poll poll with Kerry 48 Bush 44 and Nader with 6 Jeesh I guess this is why I am addicted to watching this horserace Everyday there is new information to factor The best blog to view the horserace in my opinion is urlLink Real Clear Politics 

34	So to honor those who have protected our freedom I m posting this link to past urlLink Congressional Medal of Honor citation recipients Please take a few minutes to read some of them They give me the chills everytime I read them 

34	urlLink here is the link visibly angry Bill Clinton 

34	This past weekends games of the Dodgers playing the Yankees brought back alot of memories for me First let me say that I used to be a Dodger fan through and through I have not followed them too closely lately because quite frankly they suck The last straw for me was when they traded Mike Piazza and then proceeded to sell the team to Fox Now a guy from Boston named Frank McCourt owns the team What s wrong with that picture Anyway I remember vividly the two back to back world series that the Dodgers and Yankees played back in the late seventies I remember Mr October Reggie Jackson hitting three bombs in one game to win the series and rip our hearts out I remember the rundown where Steve Garvey threw the ball back to the second baseman and Reggie stuck his wide body in front of the ball and the ball then hitting him Tommy Lasorda ran out to argue but it was all for not My my how baseball has changed from those days Anyone remember these guys And who could forget this moment in time 

34	Did everyone hear or see the news of the first privately funded space flight today Things like this show the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the American people Spaceship One pilot Mike Melvill was aiming to fly 62 miles above the Earth s surface and he just exceeded that goal reaching 62 21 miles according to radar data At first I thought the story was a hoax but then I saw the actual footage when I got home from work today Truly amazing urlLink Here is the link 

34	I wanted to share with everyone here on the blog of my experience at the urlLink Reagan Library Ronald Reagan was my hero He championed freedom and liberty more than any modern politician IMO I left my house at 7 45pm The drive to the library is about 100 miles from my house My wife and I arrived at the staging area of Moorpark College at 12 30am this morning after waiting three and half hours just to get off the freeway We got in the line for the shuttle at 1am this morning At 6am we finally boarded the bus to the library The five hour wait in line seemed to go by very fast as we made many new friends while waiting At 6 20am we arrived in the rotunda where the President s body lay in repose It really was a surreal moment and it was all I could do to hold back tears The viewing lasted no more than two minutes I will never forget this day as long as I live Rest in peace Mr President 

34	Did everyone know that Slick Willie s aka Bubba new Presidential portrait is out I got a sneek preview of it I had no idea that the artist included some historical accuracy in the painting 

34	I didn t get to see much of it except for a few sound bites I did read the transcript though What a loser Feel free to ask a tough question Dan Everything is all about Bill That guy is so selfish I hear that Bubba did an interview with a guy from the BBC last week and it is scheduled to be aired this week sometime In it Bill loses his temper when the subject of Monica is brought up Poor bubba He doesn t like it when someone asks him a tough question Is anyone out there in blogville considering buying his book I will not waste a dime on it I would like to hear some feedback from anyone that does read it though Maybe I ll read through some of it on my next trip through the bookstore for free 

34	As many of you may know from looking at my profile I am a licensed commodities broker with the National Futures Association I just wanted to let everyone know that with intrest rates on the rise there is a tremendous opportunity to take advantage of this by speculating in the bond market the Eurodollar market to be more specific If anyone would like to discuss this investment opportunity with me I d be glad to share a few minutes on the phone with you The name of the firm I work for is called urlLink Excel Futures Their phone number is 888 959 9955 

34	It s looking more and more like Bush is getting a nice Reagan bump in the polls lately This couldn t have come at a more opportune time The Harris poll is showing Bush up by ten points with likely voters and six points with registered voters I still think the race is a dead heat but the recent signs are positive for W 

34	As the old C R clothiers ad used to say what a difference a day makes all I can say is wow In one 24 hour period the Lakers have given Phillip his walking papers alienated Shaq to the point of him demanding a trade Kobe saying he is opting out of his contract Horace Grant retiring and anything else that I forgot It truly has been an amazing turn of events for the LA Lakers Feel free to hit the panic button anytime now Mitch Kupchak or dial 911 and hope Jerry West answers the phone because this team is officially done for awhile I used to joke about the Clippers being the lakers JV team but now they might give the Lakers a run for their money for the right to call themselves the best team in LA 

34	Well I have finally gotten around to start my own blog I figured it was timely since the 2004 elections are fast approaching I will try to post a couple of times per day or as events warrant I value any constructive criticism By the way I named the blog after my favorite college sports team UCLA Their football uniform color is powder blue hence the name of the blog 

34	It looks like a classic buy the rumor sell the fact day as we say in stockbroker lingo The trading today over at urlLink Intrade s Presidential Futures is up for Bush With markets everything is factored into the equation It seems that people are realizing that now that the DNC convention is over Bush is looking better and better This week was a high water mark for Kerry It s all downhill from here I m glad to say for John Kerry He may even get a small bounce from the convention but it still doesn t change the fact that people who are wagering real money are still betting on Bush 

34	With all the hubbub about the DNC convention this week I forgot to mention that Dr Tom Coburn won a huge primary victory in Oklahoma this week Tom Coburn is a strong conservative and was backed by the Club For Growth It s another sign that the Club is fast becoming a kingmaker and RINO killer Tom s main opponent was Tulsa mayor Kirk Humphreys Humphreys was the choice of the RNC the so called safe pick but Oklahoma can do better and they did It s another reason that the RNC should not pick favorites in the primary like they tend to do Let the voters decide Tom will face off against his successor in the house when he retired Brad Carson Oklahoma is a very Republican state and Tom should do well in November with Bush at the top of the ticket Rep Carson did not even go to his own party s convention because he is afraid of being seen with all the freaks there this week Actually probably a smart move for him 

34	I am the only one that noticed that Kerry was sweating like a pig up there on stage I thought it was hilarious They needed to crank up the AC in the arena I also heard the stage manager curse at the guys in the rafters while watching CNN He was heard saying what the fuck are you guys doing up there drop all the balloons and confetti now As for the speech itself it was Kerry trying to pretend that he was a Republican He hammered away that he would be a better command in chief than Bush He didn t really talk about his record in the Senate for the last twenty years but that s okay because I m sure Karl Rove et al will make sure that Kerry s voting record gets exposed for what it is and that is extremely liberal I can t wait for the RNC now Oh yeah I almost forgot Kerry says he was born in the west wing of the hospital in Colorado I beg to differ He was born in the left wing of the hospital 

34	I happen to like seeing red meat at political conventions Today s conventions are too scripted The campaigns from both sides are trying to put a moderate face on their candidates This is IMO a disservice to the voters Having said all this the Kerry campaign is probably not to happy about Reverand Al s speech last night He didn t follow the script very well or at all I watched the speech on CNN After he was done you could almost see Judy Woodruff blowing a gasket She looked pissed off After all she and most others in the media are liberal and she knows as well as anyone that Al s speech did not play well in Peoria as they say In fact I think it turned off many swing voters They then went to Candy Crowley behind the podium to interview the Reverend after the speech Her first question Was that speech approved by the Kerry campaign Al s answer I got approval for the tone of the speech from them I highly doubt that Candy then followed up with this question were your actual words approved Reverend Sharpton Al s answer I told them that I needed to answer Bush s speech from last Friday s Urban League meeting I then switched channels to Chris Matthews He was livid also How dare this man come out and give a red meat speech like he did The only saving grace for Kerry is that most people probably did not and will not see or hear about Al s speech 

34	urlLink I don t know how these stories would get told if there wasn t a Matt Drudge of the world In another huge scoop Drudge is reporting that the war footage that John Kerry s campaign plans to use to introduce John Kerry was all reenactments This guy Kerry is turning out to be pathological Most guys in the military will tell you that they never try to call attention to their service It just isn t done In fact most guys if asked about their combat experience are extremely reluctant to say anything about it A few guys have told their stories to be sure but to glorify it like Kerry is doing is disengenuous at its best and pathological at its worst The story says that after a couple of firefights Kerry went into town to purchase a super 8 video camera and then went back to the scenes of the battles and had other people film him walking resolutely through the jungle and reenacting certain things for the camera I m wondering if this sort of activity is encouraged by the military I m guessing it is not but i m going to check it out Maybe in addition to those purple hearts we could add some sort of military censure or court martial This should be interresting 

34	Memo to Kerry campaign RE Selling John F ing Kerry It s not going to work running as a moderate I m officially naming this gathering The Reinvention Convention You might as well take your chances and run as a true blue liberal Why don t you want to run as one You clearly are the most liberal Senator in the Senate We all know it kills you to moderate your message Just drop all pretense and run far to the left You ll feel liberated after doing so Also just another piece of advice you might want to have a talk with that trophy wife of yours I know she is now a billionaire but she is not keeping her end of the bargain up Put a muzzle on her The contrast between Laura Bush and Thereza is striking You won t win the Presidency because of your wife but you could lose it if she keeps running her mouth 

34	Wow where should I begin My opinion of the first night of the DNC is that it was the same old same old First Al Gore came out and appeared heavily sedated Gone was the animated Move On org Al Gore of the last few years I think he had to promise Kerry s staff that he would take his prozac before the speech and it showed Next we had Jimmy Carter You know it s bad for the Democrats when Jimmy Carter has to give the red meat speech of the convention I don t know what s funnier Jimmy Carter lecturing Bush about the evils of North Korea or him saying that we had lost credibility with the rest of the world community translation of world community France Germany On to Mrs Monotone errr I mean Hillary Clinton This women needs a speech coach in the worst way She has no inflexion in her voice It is just one long annoying monotone She has four years to work on all these things because she is going to be the nominee in 2008 when kerry loses this year Lastly we had Bubba He is the Democrats rock star of the convention That man can deliver a speech You may not agree with it but he gives a great speech without sounding like a liberal You can tell he loves being on the stage He didn t want to leave it last night 

34	urlLink Ahh who could forget this moment It brings back so many good memories 1988 was the first year that I got to cast my ballot and I proudly voted for George HW Bush This picture must be bittersweet for all my Democrat friends out there You have to admit it though liberals the picture brings to mind the phrase fish out of water Maybe they could put John Kerry in a picture with him working a normal job I mean he s never had to work a regular job or meet a payroll deadline as an employer in his life except for the few years that he was a soldier which by the way I give him credit for God knows he looks like a fish out of water when he is around normal people 

34	I hope this is just a rumor Drudge had something today on his website saying that USA Today had hired Michael Moore to be a columnist from the convention They also hired Ann Coulter to write columns from the DNC convention I don t think having Michael Moore at the RNC gathering is such a very good idea First us Republicans need to eat and by having Moore there he might eat all the food and not leave any for others Second if i were him I really wouldn t be showing my face at that convention I mean doesn t he have another conspiracy movie to film I can t wait to hear more about this from USA Today 

34	That s the time time left until the Presidential election On tap this week is the Democratic National Convention Boy I m I excited about watching it NOT It appears set to become a bash Bush convention I hope it is so the few people that will actually watch it see how desperate the Democrats are these days I m convinced that there is not a majority out in America of hate Bush people They will be just preaching to the choir If it becomes a Michael Moore type of convention you can kiss the Presidency goodbye for another four years dems 

34	urlLink It looks like Kobe Bryant will be around for the Lakers afterall this upcoming season In what has to seen as a devastating blow to the prosecution the judge in the case Terry Ruckriegle has just ruled today that the accuser s sex life in the 72 hour period prior to and after the alledged rape can be used against her as exculpatory evidence This oughta just about wrap up this case I don t think any reasonable jury is going to convict someone for rape if it can be shown that the accuser was basically slutting around prior to and after the alledged incident This begs the question of why this case was even filed in the first place I wouldn t be surprised if the plug is pulled on this case and Kobe settles the soon to be civil suit for a few million dollars Case closed Kobe a a few million dollars poorer but he just signed a 140 million contract with the Lakers so he is not hurting and he has his freedom back 

34	I won t go over all of them but suffice to say the Edwards VP selection bounce has all but disappeared according to urlLink Real Clear Politics cumulative poll average This is not good news for the Kerry campaign They should be up by at least six or seven points right now They probably will get their other bounce when their convention is over next week To add insult to injury Bush is still winning in the futures market too albeit by a very slim margin You also had Alan Greenspan telling Congress this week that the recovery is not weak and it is in fact very robust so much so that he warned that the Fed would aggressively raise rates to combat inflation should it occur In the end the economy will once again be the deciding factor in the race assuming that a catastophic event doesn t take place between now and the election 

34	urlLink This week does mark the 35th anniversary of Ted Kennedy s murder errr I mean accidental death alledgedly of Mary Jo Kopechne at the Chappaquiddick bridge After a night of debauchery Ted was driving down the road and drove his car off a bridge He escaped with his life but his passenger Mary Jo was not as lucky She ended up drowning and Ted didn t report the incident to the authorities until the next morning No one is really shocked that he beat the rap After all he is a Kennedy I m sure papa Joe made a few calls and made the whole thing go away It s also ironic that on the 35th anniversary of the incident that the DNC is in Boston next week Coincidence 

34	How many people in the US have walked into the National Archives and stuffed classified documents down their pants and their socks I can understand maybe forgeting that certain documents were in your binder or something but your pants The whole story is not making sense unless Sandy Burgler was trying to cover up something from the prior administration Just my thoughts though 

34	Today was a momentous day in the financial markets I ve been a broker for almost eight years now and I have never seen Mr Greenspan come right out and telegraph a rise in interest rates like he did today In my opinion everyone needs to get ready for this eventuality The people with adjustable rate mortgages should be ready to at the very least hedge their exposure to a rise in interest rates This can be easily done by selling short Eurodollar treasury bonds note futures Needless to say there can be alot of money made by speculating in this market right now too If anyone is interrested in how this might work please give me a call at the office The firm i m at is called urlLink Excel Futures The phone number is 888 959 9955 

34	urlLink I guess stuffing your socks with classified documents was not such a good idea after all was it Sandy Needless to say he has stepped down as an advisor to the Kerry campaign I could pile on some more but as the old saying goes when someone is in the middle of destroying themself and their credibility just stay out of the way 

34	The Academy award winning flopper whiner Vlade Divac has apparently agreed to terms with the Lakers after playing for the Suckramento Queens the last six years according to a source at ESPN Did the Lakers really have a choice I mean they don t have a bona fide center right now after trading Shaq away Welcome back to the fold Vlade I think Now that your a Laker again and in light of your diminishing skills advancing age may I suggest you ready yourself this season for the acting performance of your lifetime We ll need it 

34	In a further sign that Democrats have no sense of humor They have berated Arnold for calling them girlie men Never has so much been said about so little He was just poking fun at himself and the process in my opinion The hyper sensitive gay bi sexual transgender lobby needs to chill out urlLink What Arnold was saying was that the Democrats were so beholden to groups like trial lawyers and unions that they have no guts to make decisions on what s best for the state I say you go Arnold That s what we elected him to do We needed him to shake up the business as usual democratic legislature I think he should keep holding out until he gets the spending cuts and laws repealed that he wants

34	This guy is incredible After laughing in the face of testicular cancer urlLink Lance Armstrong is all but assured his sixth Tour de France title in a row This must kill the Frenchies to see an American come and win their national event for the sixth straight time in as many years I nominate Lance Armstrong for whatever position in government he wants Senator representative governor dog catcher whatever he wants Anyone that can go and punk the French the way he does year after year deserves everyone s praise urlLink 

34	She was sentenced today to five months in the slammer five months of home confinment and two years probation My thoughts She lied to federal prosecutors When you lie to the feds and get caught there are consequences She should have known better than to dump her stock in Imclone after getting tipped about the FDA approval or lack thereof for their drug they were developing She used to be a stockbroker herself so to claim there was some sort of stop loss sell order when there wasn t one was bogus I m a stockbroker commodity broker myself Believe me every non discretionary order from a client has to be written on a ticket and saved for future audits by the NASD and NFA Most brokers also tape record the order with the client so there is no confusion She and her broker didn t have anything to back up their claim that there was a good until canceled GTC sell stop for her account It s only cheating if you get caught and Martha you got caught Just shut up and pay your dues I m sure you will be showing all the other inmates how much potential there is to each and every cell to decorate 

34	After urlLink Sen John McCain introduced VP Dick Cheney at a rally in Michigan the washington press corp have officially gone into meltdown mode First off politics is a contact sport Lots of past Presidents have switched VPs midstream for various reasons The last one I can remember is Nixon chosing Michigan house and minority leader Gerald Ford to be his Veep when Spiro Agnew resigned because of IRS problems I m not saying that Bush is going to replace Cheney with McCain but I wouldn t be shocked if it actually happened I m sure they have lots of polling data to back up any decision they make Bush is a very loyal man but if he thinks he needs a change of scenery at the Veep spot then i m sure He wouldn t hesitate to pull the trigger In fact Karl Rove is out here in Irvine CA today for a big GOP meeting and i m sure it is being secretly discussed right now urlLink 

34	Kerry gave a black power salute to the NAACP convention today What exactly does this mean and why can a cracka like Kerry do this It s not like he has to try and woo the black vote He already has 85 of it last poll I checked I m wondering if Bush attended the convention and gave the salute what would happen to him He would have probably been called a racist 

34	John Kerry s campaign avoided an international incident and gave Hillary a slot to speak in at the Boston convention in a couple weeks urlLink Hillary was left off the speakers list for a reason She is Edwards main rival for the nomination in 2008 The campaign didn t want to give her much if any visibility at the convention Feminist groups protested loudly that she was left off They were led by New York state democratic chairwoman Judith Hope Isn t politics fun 

34	Today at high noon is the time that Kobe will announce what team he has chosen It will be either the Clippers or the Lakers I still gotta believe that with all the moves that the Lakers have been making firing Phillip and trading Shaq that this was done to accomadate Kobe Bryant s wishes There is a part of me still though that is worried that Kobe might just want a change of scenery and go with the Clippers I guess anything is possible today after what happened to Carlos Boozer and that entire messed up situation Stayed tuned everyone UPDATE After toying with the LA Clippers and then ripping their hearts out Kobe has decided to re sign with the Lakers Come on was there any doubt It just makes total sense Basically the Lakers gave in to every one of Kobe s wishes I don t buy the argument that they got rid of Phillip and Shaq because it was the right thing to do Kobe and Dr Buss had a secret agreement I believe but Mitch had to say that Kobe wasn t calling the shots but we know otherwise 

34	This was a difficult decision by the Lakers to part company with arguably the greatest center ever but it was a move they had to make Shaq s skills are diminishing and by trading him while he still was under contract the Lakers received some good players in return Having said that Shaq is still far and away the best center in the NBA by a long way He instantly turns the Heat into contenders for next year in the East That big sigh you hear is the western conference teams breathing easier now that they only have to face him twice a year and not four or five times Minnesota and San Antonio start off prohibitive favorites in the west I can t wait to see the look on Shaq s new teammates faces when he shows up to training camp overweight and out of shape As for the Lakers obviously this is a huge gamble For all we know Kobe is going to be playing in the Colorado penal league next year or worse with the LA Clippers If either of those scenarios come to fruition the Lakers are pardon my expression F KED My educated guess though is that he re signs with the Lakers and he beats the rap in Colorado They Lakers are now also left without a center Great They are going to have to run the court like no other which is fine for Kobe That s what he has wanted to do ever since he came into the league In my opinion it is going to take them a couple of years to put all the pieces into place but once they do they could model themselves like the Michael Jordon Bulls of the 90 s 

34	Mike Ditka is starting to seriously consider running for US Senate from Illinois At first everyone thought it was just a goof but as Illinois Republicans contemplate their current standing and lack of talent to draw from Da Coach is looking more and more appealing to the rank file Obviously he has to be further vetted Sen George Allen of Virginia Chairman of the NRSC is meeting with Iron Mike today to have a heart to heart about what being a US Senator is like and what Mike can expect All systems are go right now This is the Democrats worst nightmare come true They were already popping champagne corks celebrating Obama s victory but as they say in sports you still have to play the actual game In fact an online unscientific poll by the Chicago Tribune today has Ditka leading by roughly 54 46 

34	The Senate is scheduled to vote on a procedural move to get to the gay marriage amendment vote This issue is very cut and dried for me Marriage should remain between a man and a woman We don t however in my opinion need a constitutional amendment yet The issue should be left to the states I can understand the desire to try for the amendment right now with a couple of recent court decisions i e Massachusetts Vermont and Hawaii but Bill Clinton signed DOMA Defense of marriage Act in 1996 and that is the law of the land right now DOMA basically reinforced the full faith credit clause in the constitution saying that states are allowed to not recognize gay marriage if they wish This way some states that want it can have it and others that don t want it don t have to recognize it If however this issue gets to the Supreme Court and they rule that states must recognize gay marriage it would then be appropriate to get relief via the amendment process 

34	Right now at this moment in time Bush is ahead at urlLink Intrade Presidential Futures Of course this is just a snapshot of today s moment in time but it is interresting to see that after all the kerry Edwards talk in the last week that Bush is still ahead at Intrade in all the states that he won back in 2000 If he does manage to carry all the states that he did in 2000 he would have 278 electoral votes and he would be the winner again This makes me very happy The polls put out by the various media are all well and good but nothing is more accurate than the futures markets of predicting future events The smart money is still on Bush The open intrest is over 385 000 contracts right now also a very good indicator and a very liquid market 

34	I was reading the register this morning and look who s coming to Newport Beach this Saturday None other than VP contender pretender John Edwards Here is the story from the OC Register posted here because registration required Edwards has O C lunch date Orange County s been on a roll when it comes to visits from the highest profile Democrats and the trend will continue with John Kerry s chosen running mate John Edwards stopping in for lunch at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach on Saturday Frank Barbaro chairman of the county Democratic Party and head of the county Kerry Edwards campaign said this will be the last California stop by a member of the presidential ticket before the Democratic National Convention in Boston which begins July 26 The campaign thinks it s appropriate to have the California sendoff in the Republicans back yard here in Orange County Barbaro said The event is expected to sell all 450 available seats with a minimum 1 000 per plate donation Barbaro said he expects to raise at least 500 000 and several commitments have been made for the maximum donation of 27 000 including himself county Democratic Foundation founder Wylie Aitken former Irvine Co board member Joan Irvine Smith and county Democrat icon Dick O Neill

34	As I started surfing the net this morning urlLink this story stuck out like a sore thumb for me I always said to myself that one of the ways I don t want to die is to get eaten by a shark Well some surfer named Brad Smith of Southern Australia was ambushed by two great white sharks over the weekend and killed This is not good for my phyche when I go back into the water at the beach I m always thinking about this possibility in the back of my head when i m out there body surfing or swimming This poor guy never had a chance Usually they ll bite you and release you because they mistake us humans for they favorite food seals Every time shark week comes on the Discovery channel I usually make time to watch it because they are so facinating to me 

34	It looks from the sound of everything that Shaquille O Neal is set to go the Miami Heat and Pat Riley s dictatorship Good luck to all involved there Riley is known as a strong diciplinarian and Shaq could give a crap about coming to camp in shape or improving his horrendous free throw stroke Now that the deal for all intents and purposes is done I have some thoughts Initially I didn t want him to be traded but the more I thought about it the more it made sense for the Lakers He is on the downslope of his career We might as well get something for him while we still can If he stayed he would have been a cancer in the locker room because of his lame duck status He obviously feels the Lakers disrespected him after the season Get over it Shaq Look what happened last year when he waited almost until the season had begun before he had his foot surgery when he could have taken care of it after the last season had ended His coming to training camp perpetually overweight and out of shape just showed a complete disregard for his other teammates and they always resented him for that Let s be honest here also this is now Kobe s team He doesn t like that fact at all Kobe Bryant is not going to the LA Clippers He may be stupid but he s not that stupid They never got along with each other on or off the court and that is an important consideration I expect Kobe to re sign this week with the Lakers 

34	The traffic going to and from San Diego is just getting so ridiculous We left the OC today at 1 30pm and didn t arrive in downtown S D until 3 45pm That s a trip that normally takes a little over an hour from where I live in Irvine The 5 freeway is just plain jam packed with too many cars If they re going to approve all the new housing being built they might want to think of the impact that it is going to have on congestion What sucks is that you d think on a weekend that there would be no traffic but you would be dead wrong on that assumption As I was listening to the traffic report on the radio it was nice to hear that we weren t the only ones suffering There s too many freakin people in Southern California for the current roads to handle I d be nice if our tax dollars could go towards widening and building new roads but I guess I won t hold my breath Here would be my platform if I ever ran for office 1 would be to widen and build more roads round up all the illegal immigrants and deport them back home wherever that might be don t raise any taxes cut spending across the board to get to balance and abolish speed limits on the highways I guess you could boil it down to a platform of quality of life issues Sure there are other things to do but those would be the things I would concentrate on 

34	If everyone in California and the nation didn t hear John s interview yesterday with Asa Hutchinson of the Homeland Security Dept I m highly suggesting that you take a few minutes and listen to it It is so frustrating that politicians can t answer simple questions that are put to them urlLink Here is the link for the audio The southern border is such a mess but what also is a mess is the fact that two million illegal immigrants are in California at this time and finally when the Border Partol inland enforcement made headlines by grabbing over 400 hundred illegals in the Riverside Inland empire they are ordered to stop because the immigrant activists protested louder than us ordinary citizens Here is a summary of the interview A month ago immigration activist groups like La Raza The Race How s that for a nice inoffensive name were howling in uproar because the 12 Border Patrol officers of the Temecula office were conducting sweeps in Temecula Escondido and Corona all of which are cities located in Riverside and northern San Diego counties Complaints about these sweeps aroused the ire of not only the activists but the Mexican government whose LA consulate expressed its displeasure in no uncertain terms Members of Congress also got involved berating Homeland Security for the sweeps as well About a week after the complaints spokesmen for the Border Patrol said that Asa Hutchinson the undersecretary responsible for the BP ordered them to stop the sweeps So John got an interview with Hutchinson which aired live this afternoon in the 4 00 hour John who is not a tactful guy bluntly asked Hutchinson why he ordered the patrols stopped Hutchinson began droning on about the need for coordination and about how many illegals 16 000 per week according to Hutchinson were being stopped from coming into the country in Arizona John cut him off and began demanding to know how many illegals were being rounded up in California Hutchinson didn t know John then began grilling him about how many employers had been indicted in Southern California for hiring illegals Hutchinson said he didn t know John did The answer 0 John asked if interior enforcement sweeps would begin again Hutchinson said he couldn t give away specifics about planned operations for you know security reasons John then pointed out that if we were unable to stop economic refugees from pouring across the border how could we possibly stop al Qaida Hutchinson said that yep that was a pretty important question You betcha John asked how Hutchinson planned to react when after the next 911 we learn that the terrorists came through the Mexican border in California Hutchinson said that it was really important to stop them At the end of the interview John kept demanding a yes or no answer to the following question Can I tell my listeners that Asa Hutchinson assured me that the interior sweeps by the border patrol would begin again Hutchinson refused to answer

34	In honor of our great president s birthday how about if everyone kicks in 58 to the re elect campaign for W s 58th birthday What a great present to give four more years four more years four more years 

34	When else have we been down this road before I seem to remember back in 1988 when George H W Bush picked an obscure Indiana Senator named Dan Quayle to be his running mate and he was belittled for it The media was complaining of Quayle s lack of gravitas Now I know that the mainstream media is going to treat Edwards with kid gloves because he is a democrat but it is an interresting moment of history repeating itself John Edwards is a lightweight Besides being a senator for the last six years he has no real experience to speak of I don t count chasing ambulances as experience if your wondering Edwards even admitted that he didn t start voting until a few years before he ran for the senate I think we have a case hear of Kerry getting a short lived bounce out the decision but then as reality sets in the country is going to fall back on the experience and leadership of Bush Cheney 

34	In a move that didn t generate any buzz Sen John Kerry has picked an obscure Freshman democratic senator from North Carolina to be his Vice President John Edwards is known for always giving the same stump speech about there being two Americas Kerry announced the pick in an email to supporters Ambulance chasers errr I mean trial lawyers round the country are rejoycing at the pick but ordinary Americans were overheard saying that we don t need any more lawyers in elected office 

34	Believe me Laker fans this was a blessing We did not need an unproven college coach to lead our beloved Lakers This should clear the way for Rudy Tomjanovich to be named the next coach I know Kobe wanted Kra zoo ski as their coach but i m sure that he will like Rudy T Memo to Kobe You might want to concentrate more on things at hand like oh i don t know WINNING YOUR FREEDOM 

34	Just who will John F ing Kerry choose for his Vice President My money is on HRC Hillary Rodham Clinton It just makes so much sense for Kerry and her He s supposed to announce the choice first through his website My guess is it will be announced early tomorrow morning that is of course assuming no one in the campaign leaks the name to Drudge or someone else in the media today CNN is reporting that the decision has been made Oh the intrigue By the way great fireworks show at Edison field last night I was driving home from a party in Upland and cars were pulled over to the side of the freeway to watch the show It reminded me of the Reagan funeral procession

34	Just when I thought California had gone over the liberal edge urlLink The Ca Supreme Court today announced that they are voiding all gay marriages that happened about six months ago This brings a little sanity back into process in my opinion If the people of California wanted gay marriage they would have voted for it when it was on the ballot a few years ago As it stands right now though mayors do not have free reign to hand out marriage licenses like Gavin Newsome did I m sure that gay marriage proponents are filling out their appeal to the Ninth Circuit as I m writing this I am predicting right here and now that the Ninth Circus err Circuit will overturn the California Supreme Court ruling and that the US Supremes will have to again slap the liberal 9th judges back down

34	and the Bush re elect futures contract is down two points to 52 There s not much to spin here by the Bush campaign While I agree that with them that the Labor Dept stats don t measure alot of other types of jobs like self employment independent contractors and entrepeneurs it doesn t change the fact that most people just look at the Labor Dept stats The bond market had a huge rally this morning as well What does all this mean Bush is behind a little in the media polls but he is still the favorite according to the all important futures market My prediction is that he will come out of the convention tied in the polls and about right where he is today in the futures The debates and or a future event are going to decide the election 

34	I found this article by a guy named urlLink Jim Garven It is must reading for political prognosticators I copied and pasted the article here It is from about one week ago Political futures markets The idea of relying upon futures markets prices to forecast future events has an interesting history Nearly 20 years ago Richard Roll published a paper in the American Economic Review entitled Orange Juice and Weather which showed among other things that the futures market in orange juice concentrate is a better predictor of Florida weather than the National Weather Service Since the only way one can earn excess profits in a speculative market is to gain an informational advantage over the competition traders are strongly motivated to try to do just that As I noted in my previous blog entry about political futures markets if markets are informationally efficient it follows that market prices represent unbiased forecasts concerning future events Technically this means that on average the market s estimate of the average value of the event in question is likely to be quite accurate Consequently I believe that political futures markets are more reliable indicators of the odds of a Bush or Kerry win than surveys conducted by the various media companies With this in mind it is interesting to observe what the political futures markets are telling us As Alex Tabarrok notes the market prediction of a Bush victory has hit an all time low I just checked the tradesports com website and today s closing price for the PRESIDENT GWBUSH2004 futures contract George W Bush is re elected as United States President is 49 60 which indicates that the election today is quite literally a tossup note since the tradesports contracts pay off 100 if a predefined event occurs and 0 otherwise the reported price is essentially a probability measure However it does appear that regardless of which party wins the presidential election the House and Senate will most likely have Republican majorities This is evident because today s closing price for the SENATE GOP 2004 futures contract Republicans maintain control of the US Senate in 2004 Election is 76 50 whereas today s closing price for the HOUSE GOP 2004 futures contract Republicans maintain control of the House in 2004 Election is 87 As of today 8 5 04 The re elect George W Bush contract is at 55 00

24	It was reported today on Fox News Dayside with Linda Vester that Sheikh Omar Abdel al Rahman the infamous blind cleric associated with the 1993 World Trade Center bombings has complained about none other than the type of tea he is being served while incarcerated Omar also is diabetic and continues to eat ridiculous amounts of M M s to inflict worse diabetic symptoms and was also caught on videotape beating his leg against the bars in his cell to further damage an existing injury When asked about the tea situation Omar could not remember specifically which tea was his favorite he just knew that it was not being served to him Obviously Omar is trying once again to ignite terrorist anger and trigger more terrorist activities Why this man is even being allowed luxuries such as tea while imprisoned is beyond me Personally I don t think he should have anything that is not a necessity Before you make your mind up about this situation please read the biography below to understand the type of man we are dealing with here Sheikh Omar Abdel al Rahman served as the spiritual leader to Egypt s largest militant group Al Gama a al Islamiyya formed in 1973 The group is probably best known for killing 62 people outside a site in Luxor in 1997 This group has also been linked to the International Front for Jihad against Jews and Crusaders which was formed by al Qaeda and a few other terror organizations Al Gama a originally planned to overthrow Egypt s secular regime and create an Islamic state This group believes only in jihad diplomatic resolution is not a possibility Omar issued a fatwa religious ruling justifying actions normally condemned by law for the assassination of Sadat in 1981 He only served 6 months time due to a technicality The new Egyptian leader did not tolerate terrorism and began jailing any person remotely linked to terrorist activity In 1990 Omar moved to Sudan and recieved a Sudanese passport stating that was his place of birth although that was his first visit to Sudan It has been speculated that bin Laden helped Omar acquire this passport because this is around the time the two met After he received the passport Omar went to the US Embassy and was granted a B2 VISA 6 months In 1991 he used that VISA to come to America He proceeded through claims at JFK Airport without any problems whatsoever At the time he was on the State Department s Terrorist Watch List How he was granted the VISA with no signs of the government knowing is still questioned He began delivering sermons at mosques in New Jersey and Brooklyn referring to America as Satan America and The American Whore He also stated that Allah decreed that all infidels non muslims should be put to death if they refused to convert to Islam He was creating Islamic jihad against America Omar befriended a FBI informant Salem and included him in his inner circle Obviously Omar had no idea Salem was connected with the government In 1992 Salem warned of a terror attack on one of many chosen NYC landmarks to take place in early 1993 On February 26 1993 the World Trade Center was bombed In 1996 Omar and nine other accomplices were jailed in the US for conspiracy to destroy New York City landmarks Omar continued to direct terror cells from prison often with the help of his translator and defense lawyer who were both charged in 2002 with accomplice to terrorist activities Does this sound like a man who should have a choice of tea or any tea at all for that matter 

24	CNN reported today that some 5600 retired and discharged soldiers will be involuntarily called for Active Duty The Army stated that these soldier s assistance will be needed in either Afghanistan or Iraq None of these soldiers are currently members of The National Guard or Reserve The Army has been researching a list of an estimated 118 000 eligible individual reservist for a few weeks to find soldiers experienced in areas such as civil affairs This does not make sense to me at all Why would those countries require more soldiers from us than they needed before the ruin of the Taliban or Hussein As far as Iraq is concerned the UN has agreed to train Iraqi s to ensure the stability of the country I can not even speak intelligently about Afghansitan because I lost track of the current events there since the search for bin Laden We have implemented both of these countries with civil governments How much longer do American forces need to be present Are we ever going to step out and let these countries run themselves I realize that initially all forces can not vacate but what is the purpose of sending more soldiers Furthermore why should the American people see the logic if there is any in sending retired and discharged military personnell These are men and women who have already served their country and although they may not mind becoming active again I do not think this is a fair decision

24	On July 18 1969 Mary Jo Kopechne drowned to death She was involved in a car accident with none other than Edward Ted Kennedy Kennedy and Kopechne were at a party at Chippaquiddick an area only a ferry s ride away from Martha s Vineyard The two were attending a party when they decided to go for a ride Somehow the car crashed off of the Dike Bridge and landed in a tidal pond Twelve people were in attendance at this party where Kennedy and the others had rented a cottage and were gathered for a cookout All attendees claim the party was totally innocent but five of the men were married including Kennedy and all six of the girls were single The six women were working on Robert Kennedy s presidential campaign the year before but were forced to quit in leiu of his murder Kopechne and Kennedy decided to leave the party to return to Edgartown just before midnight Kennedy claims that he turned onto a gravel road by accident and lost control of the car landing it in the pond He says that he tried to rescue Kopechne but was unsuccesful and walked back to the party He got his cousin Joseph Gargan and a friend of the family Paul Markham to go back to the scene of the accident for a second try The three men went to a ferry landing where spontaneously Kennedy dove in the water and swam across to Edgartown The two men were surprised to learn that Kennedy as of the next morning had not reported the accident yet which they were sure he would have done the night before Nine hours passed and the accident had been reported by an uninvolved part when Kennedy came forward as the driver Kennedy attended the funeral with a neck brace that he was never seen wearing again The Kopechne family refused an autopsy with a check for about 150 000 dollars from the Kennedy family showing up in their account Rumors still circulate to this day that Kopechne had told Kennedy that she was pregnant shortly before the accident This would make sense with the autopsy not being performed The events leading up to and after the accident have never been totally verified and all of the partygoers gave officials varying stories The only thing I keep thinking about is that if she was pregnant which I am pretty sure she was that baby would have been around 35 years old today I had heard about this accident and the death of Kopechne through the years but had never really read anything about it The implication that Kennedy did this on purpose is no big surprise to me The Kennedy family has also been said to have killed Marilyn Monroe because she threatened to go public with her affair with JFK Remind me to never get involved with a Kennedy although that would be hard because all of the men with the exception of Ted seem to meet their demise very young

24	Al Jazeera aired a videotape showing an unharmed Angelo de la Cruz with someone not shown on camera reading a statement issued from him The news reader stated de la Cruz wanted to thank the Phillipines president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo for her decision to withdraw troops from Iraq He also wanted his wife to wait for me I m coming back to you Wednesday eight of fifty one Filipino humanitarian troops had left Iraq and the remaining troops will be out by July 20 The Phillipines had previously vowed allegiance to the US and her allies stating Manila would not back down Apparently pressure from protestors caused a change of heart in Manila which ultimately could weaken ties with the country s allies The Phillipines decision to withdraw has received criticism from leaders of assisting countries in Iraq some of which have lost citizens of their own due to terrorist attacks The US Australia and South Korea have all issued statements expressing confusion and scrutiny regarding Manila s decision to make deals with terrorist organizations In my opinion it is a bad idea to make pacts with terrorists To me this just gives them more reason to continue the behavior that has become so frequent It reminds me of a little baby screaming and screaming until he gets his way The baby will never learn unless you just let it be and cry for a while 

24	Tuesday Al Jazeera reported that the network had received a tape of the execution of one of the Bulgarian hostages Now officials are wondering if that is true or not No one apparently has actually seen the documentation of the supposed murder but the Bulgarian government has issued a statement saying that no changes are in the future for their policies or involvement in Iraq This could be attributed to the fact that Bulgaria is a very new member of NATO and they probably don t want to piss anyone off I really hope these two hostages and all of the others are still alive and will make it home safely 

24	Al Jazeera reported today that one of the two Bulgarian hostages that were being held by the Jihad and Unification group has been killed The method of killing is not known at the time The militants have threatened to kill the remaining hostage in 24 hours if Iraqi female prisoners are not released The two hostages are Ivailo Kepov and Georgi Lazov but it is unclear at the time which is deceased The Jihad and Unification group behind these killings claim allegiance to al Zaqarwi and are reportedly responsible for the beheadings of Nick Berg and Kim Sun il An Egyptian hostage is being held hostage and his captors are threatening to kill him unless his Saudi employer leaves Iraq within 72 hours The fate of Angelo de la Cruz from the Phillipines is still undecided His captors had given an extension but the kidnappers failed to give a time or date of the announcement Officials are wondering deadline from what point in time These killings are becoming a little too frequent for my taste A month ago it was shocking and now it is easy to adapt a nonchalant attitude about it Even though I may seem like I am writing about something unimportant my prayers are with the victims and their families This is fucking ridiculous but what can you do I feel like even if everyone does what they demand they will just come up with some other reason to murder 

24	A Saudi Interior Minsitry Official announced today that Khaled al Harbi has surrendered himself to the Saudi Arabian government He turned himself in at the Saudi Embassy in Tehran Iran and was flown to Saudi Arabia It is believed that al Harbi was living somewhere near the Afghan Iran border On June 23 Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced that any terrorist or terror suspect who turned themself in within a month would be dealt with in a lighter manner than if they did not Any person classified as terrorist who turns themself in will be exempt from the death penalty al Harbi has not been charged with any attacks in Saudi which was the stipulation of the announcement Saudi government said nothing of attacks that had taken place in other countries Although al Harbi is not suspect in any attacks on Saudi soil it is highly unlikely that he will be released al Harbi fought with bin Laden against the Soviets in Afghanistan about twenty years ago and later returned to join forces with al Qaeda in the 1990 s In late 2001 al Harbi was identified on a videotape discussing the September 11 attacks with bin Laden Hundreds of people used to doubt you until this huge event happened Now hundreds of people are coming out to join you bin Laden responded that the damage caused was more than the coordinators had imagined possible We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors al Harbi stated today Undoubtedly it is an opportunity any logical man would thank God every logical man should take advantage of this opportunity I was not very sure if it was such a great idea to make deals with terrorists but in retrospect obviously this approach is working better than I thought it would It is highly doubtful that every terrorist in the world will turn themselves in but apparently this is having a different better outcome than I thought it would That is what I get for being skeptical I suppose 

24	CNN reported Friday that members of Hassoun s family had visited him in Lebanon at the US Embassy in Beirut It is being widely speculated that Hassoun was fleeing his duties as a Marine to go to Lebanon at the time of his capture or that the entire kidnapping was a hoax Officials are under the impression that he faked his kidnapping in order hide the fact that he deserted his unit Right now his story just doesn t add up and Cpl Hassoun has a lot of explaining to do The 24 year old Lebanese born Marine was raised in Lebanon leaving in 1999 for Utah to join his parents and a brother He was educated in American schools in Tripoli and joined the Marines in 2001 He had not been back to Lebanon since until his arrival at the US Embassy He married an American lady two years ago but they have since divorced He reportedly has married a cousin whom still resides in Lebanon but there was no ceremony and his father signed the marriage contract for him which is apparently permitted in Islam A spokesman for the Bahrain based American Navy s 5th Fleet said the matter is under investigation by Naval Criminal Investigative Service and another military official stated that Technically in time of war desertion is punishable by death but nobody s talking about that right now 

24	It seems that Cpl Wassef Hassoun has been released by his captors A spokesman for the abducted Marine stated that Hassoun called his family members in Lebanon and Utah to let them know he had been released He apparently called the United States Embassy in Beirut and asked for transportation His location at the time of the call has not yet been publicized There has been no confirmation from the Pentagon or the State Department verifying this information as of yet but there is no doubt in my mind he has found his way to safety Cpl Hassoun was reported missing by US Marine Corps on June 20th and the Pentagon listed him as missing on July 1st His kidnappers had threatened to behead him if the US forces did not free Iraqi prisoners The group calling itself Islamic Response stated Monday that Hassoun has been sent to a safe place after he had announced his forgiveness and his determination not to go back to the US forces The 24 year old Marine of Lebanese descent was working as a translator He is fluent in Arabic French and English I am interested to see what Hassoun has to say as far as the treatment he received while being held what exactly went on the events leading up to his capture and I am mostly anticipating seeing what he plans to do with his life now

24	Well if you are a regular reader of my blog which I don t think there are THAT many then you know that last Friday I had plans to attend a funeral of a friend of mine that drowned in the local lake I was dreading going to the funeral as would any non morbid person Of course my best friend and her boyfriend were not ready at the time we had discussed so we all show up about 10 minutes before the funeral starts I do not like being late especially to something like that where there is limited seating and everyone in the building turns around to see whose coming in the door I felt like we were on display as we walked in But at least we made it there before the funeral began Funerals are bad enough as it is but even worse when the death is unexpected And even worse when the person is young We all stood as the pall bearers brought the casket in and the family followed The sight of the casket and knowing that my deceased friend s physical remains were in there immediately started the waterworks The family was seated in the front of the church and when the preacher spoke her first words which were something to the effect of We are going to miss Travis Niles the family just let all of their emotions out Screaming crying heaving you name it and that is what was going on at the front of the church This made it one hundred times worse I had never attended a black funeral previously and this was all new to me I suppose it is healthy to not suppress any emotions and just let it all out When the service was complete everyone stood again and the casket was carried back out The family then followed but then his mother fainted just before she reached the front door Then his brother dropped to his knees and screamed Why my brother Needless to say this was by far the MOST vocal and dramatic funeral I have ever been to I hope his family comes through the grief knowing that he is in a better place and I hope Trapp is safe in heaven if there is such a place urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	I have found out the truth or what of it I could at this point about my friend s death One of my patient s works for DNR and I asked her to PLEASE find out any information that she could regarding the circumstances of his death Well as you may know gathering tidbits of information from numerous individuals mimics the game telephone Anything you hear and the final statement is convulated to say the least I found out that there are NO signs of foul play whatsoever The party was Saturday night not Friday night and it was evident that he died simply from drowning A bunch of people had taken a pontoon from the house where the party was to a lakeside bar called Dockside They continued drinking heavily and on the way home Trapp asked if he could drive the boat They said no because he was so fucked up I guess when they arrived back at the house or at some point he wanted to leave but could not find his keys He wandered off alone and that was it The next thing anyone heard of him he was floating face down in the lake Sunday the people of the house needed to get out of the driveway and his Tahoe was in the way Trapp had left his keys in someone s car by accident and that person came with the keys to move the vehicle so it was no longer blocking the driveway Everyone thought he was either shcacked up with some stripper somewhere or some girl in general I suppose or that he had gone in another car with someone else My take on it is that he probably walked down to the lake ALONE stepped of the dock or slipped into the water by accident freaked out because he could not touch and could not swim and drowned His BAL was 27 I am still upset but feel somewhat better knowing that he was not murdered urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	Well today is the day that a slew of my friends and myself mourn the death of Travis Niles whom we referred to as Trapp If you are new to this blog and have not skimmed any previous posts Trapp was a friend of mine that died this past weekend His body was found floating Monday morning in the local lake The conditions surrounding his death are evidently strange and I am not the only one in thinking that they point directly to foul play Also I found out that he had three children not just the daughter as I had previously thought His other two children live with their mother and I doubt that he was as close to them as he was the daughter I mentioned before Today is going to SUCK It will definitely be a whose who of people in our town which mind you is not very big to begin with I was born here in Columbia SC but was raised in Australia and Atlanta I am still getting used to the confined span of this small city after two years Anyway a friend of mine said that she would not be surprised if cops were there since foul play is suspected at this point They always say murderers can t stay away either they go back to the scene of the crime or the funeral urlLink Blogroll Me

24	Things just are not adding up In the past two days all sorts of different stories have been flying around about what actually caused his death First I heard he was shot Then someone brought up the possibility that maybe he was on a boat with someone fell off into the water and drowned causing the people he was with to freak out and dip without saying anything to anyone Maybe it is just me but why would he even be in a boat with a bunch of inebriated crazies when he did not even know how to swim And if he was shot don t you think the paper would have stated that instead of stating that the only conclusions drawn from the autopsy regarding cause of death was drowning Someone please give me an outside opinion on this because when people have an emotional attachment to an individual they are less likely to think rationally That funeral tomorrow will be weird as shit especially since a lot of his friends including myself are POSITIVE that foul play was involved urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	Police claim that Mark Hacking confessed to killing his pregnant wife Lori When Mark was a patient at a psychiatric hospital he admitted to another patient that he had murdered his wife with a knife as she slept Yesterday police released a video from a convenient store showing Mark Hacking shortly after the time officials think he killed Lori The video shows Hacking checking his hands not making eye contact with other patrons of the store and pulling something out of his watch Officials also said that a knife with Lori s blood on it was found in the apartment and her blood was found on the headboard of the couple s bed Hacking told the witness at the psychiatric hospital that after killing Lori he dumped her body in a dumpster I knew this asshole killed his wife and I hope his karma comes swiftly and causes him as much pain as he caused Lori and his unborn child Fucking weirdo urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	It was about 6 30 yesterday afternoon and I had my purse in hand ready to walk out the door The phone began to ring and I was having an internal debate on whether or not to pick it up Something told me to get it I needed to It was my friend Teia calling to tell me that out friend Trapp had been found early that morning floating in the lake He had drowned at some point over the weekend and his body washed up behind someone s home in Ballentine a small lakeside town with mostly residential lake property Initially I was shocked She told me that someone out there had a party on Friday night someone took Trapp s keys from him because he was too drunk to drive and no one saw him after that until his body was found in the lake early Monday morning This all seemed a little strange to me in retrospect after the intial shock wore off enough for me to actually logically think about the situation You see Trapp was not a stupid person It is not like he would have gone swimming by himself if he was intoxicated in any manner So the only thing that I could think was that he got pissed because someone took his keys he never stayed in the same place for very long on a weekend night and wandered off by himself At that point he possibly fell and hit his head and was unconscious by the time he hit the water Or at least something like that But even that seemed weird like it was not the correct explanation Today I found out that the police found his truck windows down keys in it and his wallet in the truck parked close to the site of the party There is no way in hell he would have left his wallet in the truck and the keys in the ignition No way If anything he would have locked everything in the truck and taken the keys with him This new little tidbit of information makes me think that someone did something to him almost like he was lured out of the truck or something And then there is no telling who was at that party and why he was alone if he had gotten his keys back Obviously he had the intention of leaving the party but I know he did not ride out there alone Someone had to ride with him and I find it very strange that no one talked to him since Friday night at the party and no one found it weird that they had not heard from him the rest of the weekend I will keep an update going on this post just in case any of you are interested to see what the final determination is please say a prayer for my friend and his family Especially his little girl whom is now left without a father urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	Have you ever made a direct comment to someone respectfully requesting something when someone else chimes in and shares their unwanted view I really hate it when that happens It makes me happy that I do not own a gun and it also makes me happy that this particular person s only interaction with me is via the internet Why is it that certain people just love to argue It is not like they are arguing for some profound reason but simply because they have NOTHING better to do with their time You know there are some people who have their little list of blogs that they visit and when a topic arises that peaks that individual s interest they more than likely will post a comment before going on with their life Then there are other people whose existence thrives on blogs this is the only happiness that they know because for some reason or another they have been cast aside by the TANGIBLE world around them I think it is hyterical call me a bitch or whatever but I do think it is hilarious What a sad life that must be Some people have problems with food and wake up in the middle of the night yearning for a snack but the abov mentioned type of person wakes up in the middle of the night thinking of the next comment they are going to post If you spend the majority of your day on the computer surfing your respective list of blogs I am sorry if this offends you However if your use of blogs is purely recreational when you have nothing else to do or may be bored then you know what I am talking about Let me put it this way if someone directly speaks to you then you have every right to comment Otherwise stay the fuck out of it If you can t stand that someone called you out when you have been harping on the same fucking topic for a motherfucking week and you happen to disagree with the fact that it has become extremely boring and because of the issue being discussed for so fucking long the majority of readers have lost every ounce of interest then you need to get a fucking psychiatric exam You also need to acquire a backbone and be able to understand that whatever may stimulate your mind stimulates very few other minds What the fuck ever I really can t stand some people but all you can do is just say FUCK IT and go on with your life and be thankful that you have one outside of Silicone Valley urlLink Blogroll Me 

24	Aaaaaagh I never thought I would say this but thank God it is Monday and I am back at work I normally write about meaningful topics but I just have to vent This is my blog so I can do that if I want to Anyway my friends are getting married next weekend All of the women folk took a weekend trip to the beach for my girl s bachelorette party Okay maybe it was not such a bright idea to make it a weekend thing or maybe it was the maturity level of a couple of people who went There were seven of us who are friends and hang out a lot The other two involved NEVER hang out with any of us other than the bachelorette One girl was her best friend from this point on she will be referred to as friend and the other was her cousin from this point on she will be referred to as cousin Obviously friend and my friend have taken two totally seperate turns on the personality highway if you catch my drift She was very miserable the entire time jealous and just making little jabs at a couple of the girls all weekend and hardly ever smiled The cousin was overweight seemed to have not been out much and very sheltered and very much wanting to impress the rest of us girls She obviously thought that there was only one type of low carb high protein diet I think the only one she had ever heard of was the Atkins Diet because she got into an argument with me about it She said that on the low carb diet you can eat cheese I told her Yeah on Atkins you can eat cheese bacon whatever just no carbs Like if you get a sandwich you don t eat the bread and in general limit your carbs She did not get that there were different variations of the low carb diet so I just gave up in the midst of her screaming and said What the fuck ever I don t care Then we all went out Saturday night to a club called Kryptonite and she was actually trying to wear tennis shoes what kind of club lets you in wearing tennis shoes Not any I have ever been to The friend was trying to make me feel sorry for her at the club I asked her why she was not drinking and she said If I buy a drink I can t feed my baby all week I guess she thought I would be like Oh I ll buy you one you poor thing but I did not I just told her to get a dude to buy her drink she said her husband would not appreciate it I told her he should have given her more money then Next time there is a bachelorette party someone please remind me to get my own room Nine bitches in a condo with two bedrooms and two baths does not work especially when two of them are weird as hell Actually if those two were eliminated from the equation there would have been no drama I am sure urlLink 

24	I knew it I knew this guy killed his wife Police arrested Mark Hacking the husband of the missing pregnant Salt Lake City woman this morning for aggrevated murder Mark was arrested about 11 00 this morning Salt Lake City time For the past couple of weeks Mark had been in a psychiatric facility after police found him running around his hotel parking lot naked It was quite obvious to me at least that Mark Hacking was guilty of killing his wife If you ever taken the time to read the timeline of events leading up to and after her disappearance you would have thought he was guilty from the get go as well Basically the week before her disappearance Lori was very upset after receiving a phone call at work from UNC Chapel Hill telling her that her husband had not been admitted to medical school there Lori was under the impression he had been and that the couple would shortly be moving to North Carolina After her disappearance police found out that contrary to what everyone including Mark s parents thought Mark never even graduated from the University of Utah Mark would leave books open all over the apartment to give Lori the impression that he was studying all of the time Police found out that the majority of his time was spent at a store close to their home drinking smoking and playing cards Mark had asked the owners and other patrons to never tell Lori that he smoked because they were Morman and Lori was very much against smoking The morning her disappearance was reported Mark was seen buying a new mattress He then called family and friends a good hour before he contacted police to report her missing Over this past weekend the family held a press conference stating that they had learned new information regarding Lori from Mark and asked that any searches for her cease Like I said before I knew it I just feel awful for her and her family Maybe Mark was watching all of this coverage of the Peterson trial and thought it was worth a shot to try the same thing If there was any doubt in my mind before that he had not been involved in her disappearance which there was not but had there been it would have stopped today as soon as I found out that he told the family something to make them call off the search for Lori urlLink Blogroll Me

24	I m not quite sure why but I have this strong desire to write the stories of the people who have died in the War in Iraq I m not particularly patriotic the opposite of really but I do believe very strongly in the fact that everyone has a story and I want to find it So maybe on some days I ll start posting articles of the war casualties on this blog so that I can research them later Who knows Might be something cool 

24	First urlLink this and now urlLink this I m grabbing a baseball bat and Mel Gibson and heading to the basement 

24	I just found urlLink this article on CNN about a girl that was denied communion because of a wheat allergy Dude seriously I thought the Catholic church was having enough problems keeping its members around I understand that they want to keep tradition alive and I agree with that having converted to Catholicism myself to be a member of a denomination that was rife with ritual and tradition but denying an eight year old her first communion because she s got an allergy to wheat It sounds to me like some exception could be made especially since it s a urlLink sacrament and if you don t received them you can like go to Hell or something I was at a wedding this summer a very traditional wedding in an old Methodist Church and the bride and groom took their own version of communion with their personal holy food Sprite and cheese for the groom and popcorn and lemonade for the bride That s something that makes sense to me If Christ can indeed be found every where he can be found in cheese as well as wheat laden wafers as well as rice laden wafers Give the kid some communion 

24	I ve been in contact with urlLink Matthew Everett a playwright in Minneapolis who happens to really really like my work Which is way cool I ve asked him to help me find out about writing groups grants putting a show together and performance opportunities I think with him helping I might indeed be able to put together a show for next year Now if only I could figure out a way to get my picture up on my blog they all would be good Here s today s Irish feature of the day from The Kerryman urlLink Rain Fails to Dampen Puckish Spirit If you choose not to create an account in order to read the story it s the top feature article of the day about a goat named Elivs that was chosen for the annual Puck festival But legend has it that if an all white goat is chosen it will rain Elvis was all white and rain it did Next year they re going to look for a goat of a different color 

24	The urlLink article that I posted a little while ago was about Eddie this dude that I had read about and then met in Ireland I ve told the story often on this dude but had never actually taken the time to actually read about him What the article doesn t tell you is the really fun stuff Yeah he s an English teach in Limerick but according to one of my flatmates from Trinity College he also talks to the faeries in the middle of class She would tell me stories about how he would stop in the middle of a lecture and look around frantically and start talking to the faeries that only he could see When there was a proposal by the Irish government to join the EU the one stipulation was that they work on the roads in Ireland to facilitate trade and travel and if you ve ever been on the Irish roads you know it s needed The road was supposed to be widened between Ennis and another town but a hawthorn bush was marked for destruction Eddie stepped in because it was the metting place for two tribes of faeries and if it was destroyed the faeries would die out because they tribes couldn t meet up before they went into battle together and it was also dangerous to anyone who would be driving on the roads because the faeries were likely to attack Eddie started a campaign went to the government and the road was rerouted to save the bush Ireland is truly the only country I know to stop progress in the name of magic But the story does have a somewhat tragic epilogue and urlLink here it is from Eddie s own website

24	I ve never really had a blog before but have decided to start one for prepping a show for the urlLink Minnesota Fringe Festival 2005 My apologies in advance for most of this blog being pretty much dribble about Ireland Irish stories and Irish news articles as that is what I hope my show will shape up to be As for the title of the blog Check out this news article about the smoking ban in Ireland and the largest complaint so far a few months into the ban urlLink http news bbc co uk 2 hi uk news 3854699 stm If you read down you will see that one of the complaints about the ban is that now that the smell of smoke is gone it has unmasked the smells of the drinkers farts Dude How funny is that If anyone sees any more articles about Irish curiosities please post them in comments I never know where my inspiration for my writing will come Later 

14	3 things need to be disscussed 1 this infernal camp is ruining everyones life and i propose a crusade to ruin his camp 2 we would go after CALIFORNIA but we have no chance of gettting there so curse u tucker 3 racheal stop complaining on the TED blog i see comments and then i say OO COMMENTS and then its just like life is so hard and im a gunker and sucide and sucide stop it NO ONe LEAVE even though i am but not very long 

14	Well it turns out nothing is going to happen tomorrow Tuesday after all Quiggy s at some camp and Eric s going to the beach so That about wraps that up Uh I ll post the next prospective date s as I always do Okay then 

14	Well I also have a hankering to record I was thinking that Sunday might be good but of course I need the others approval as well We ll probably just be needing Eric Quiggy and me for this one although others can come if we E Q and I decide we need them All right so Sunday then maybe Right Update Well Sunday s not going to work it would seem Instead we re going to try planning for Tuesday All right Not Sunday Tuesday Oh and I also still have to ask my parents so Right plan for Tuesday but don t stake your life on it Another update Okay so yeah I checked it out with the authority figures and Tuesday is good However I d just like to repeat that we re probably just going to need Eric Quiggy and me Unless Eric says differently because I am but a humble bass player incapable of making decisions on my own Eric s the visionary so I let him make all the decisions 

14	we need some recording will lose the momentum we dont have and i have songs with lyrics so in ur face all those poeple who said i couldnt do it but no one said that RECORD 

14	Well on Tuesday we had another recording session with Eric Tucker Quiggy Sporko Gabo and me I felt sorry for Gabo there wasn t much for her to do Gus missed this recording session too which is mildly irksome It doesn t matter that much because we didn t get a whole lot done In fact the only thing we actually recorded something that Quiggy played got erased accidentally So in fact we didn t actually get anything done It was still great fun though There was some madness when it was raining and we all ran and frolicked outside I got drenched and covered in mud thank you Gabo but it was awesome For a bit it was like being in a Beatles movie like the scene from a Hard Day s Night where they re all running in the field Eric stayed after hours and we messed around with audioblogging the results of which are below and also on AIM Even if we didn t get much done it was still good to get together I don t know when we ll next meet but here s hoping that it s soon By the way seeing as I am the one always writing these sort of things does this also make me sort of the band journalist Just wondering It s all about the credit as Eric said

14	i hereby declare that if the mention matt vessey does not supply the musical group TED with 3 songs by tomorrow at the recording session TWO things will happen 1 MAtt Vessey will be thrown from the top of dougs roof and eaten by wild dogs after a brief reception with cake and jazz band 2 Eric Johnstons head will explode from thinking 

14	i can post things now i just thought id tell u 

14	Well why don t we try what we did before Let s say you just show up as close to 11 as possible and leave as late as say 6 How s that sound with you people

14	Well we re not doing it tomorrow I haven t heard back from anybody except from people okay one person saying they couldn t do it so don t bother showing up tomorrow I m going to try for Monday I think That gives us all a bit more time 

14	All right I m putting this post up as an unofficial invite to get together for another recording session tomorrow I was thinking basically the same time slot 11 6 or so As I realize this is something of short notice it could be postponed to whenever if that is more convenient for people Or it could just be part of Ted Anyway we need to get together My house bring whatever equipment you need 

14	Well it s taken me long enough to write it up but here it finally is On Saturday Eric lead guitar urlLink Tucker guitar urlLink Quiggy clarinet keyboards urlLink Spork groupie drums and I bass ventured into my studio to make Ted history We stayed down there for five to six hours practicing and recording We ended up with most of one song recorded and let me say it sounds pretty good We re recording using my urlLink iMac and some other equipment We ve found urlLink GarageBand to be a great tool for recording Anyway Eric just comes up with more and more ideas for songs so you can be sure that Ted will be getting together in the future for more sessions like this 

14	Calling all members of Ted We should be getting together at my house for practice recording at around 11 today until as long as you can stay If you need directions I suggest you look online for them because I m no good at them Anyway I ll be on AIM if you need me for anything else

14	We are most likely doing crossdressing day people It would be tomorrow Please inform your non BotD friends about it And your BotD friends 

14	IM TOTALLY ALL FOR THE CROSS DRESSING THING BUT how are we gonna pull it off are we just going to come into school in regular uniform and bring a pair of pants and then just exchange with each other in bettween u cna wear the pants and whatnot Im all for it i think we should start a phone chain and circulate the word each person calls two other people ok well i gtg im all for it tho 

14	i am back i know you all missed me the cross dressing thing has to happen i mean thatd be amazing in case your wondering what i did when i was in new orleans this is what i did shopped went on a few vampire tours with tony hung out at burbon street walked around the french quarter and had a great time anyway i had fun and i know you all missed me 

14	Geez Gabo tell the whole world 

14	Please can we have a cross dressing day I mean Taco used to running around his yard wearing a kilt screaming You can take our lives but you ll never take our freedom anyway 

14	Hey everybody I haven t been heard from in a long time cause my internet failed on me but I m back never fear Oh and by the way FOOT THONGS ROCK 

14	This is Dougie speaking on Sporko s behalf since she is in New Orleans and must pay for an Internet connection with money out of her own pocket Getting to the point Sporko wants people to bring their yearbooks with them to school so that she might have a chance to sign them I m bringing mine you should too 

14	Unfortunatly it is unlikely that a cross dressing day will happen The only day it is possible is Tuesday Monday and Thursday we have off Wednesday is the awards ceremony for the atletic awards and honors Mrs Braxton will be taking pictures and obviously due to commencement we will be unable switch on Friday That is of course unless Katie is willing to give up her Versace dress or Cimmie plans on losing a hundred pounds so she can fit in a guy s outfit Nevertheless we have to do this switch on Tuesday if at all This wont work if someone forgets or backs out thinking Oh my God if I cross dress I won t graduate because they ll expell me We need to coordinate plans since our only choice of a day is the next day we have school We need to figure out something soon My Idea is the following In this chatterbox write your name if you are willing to participate Maybe we ll do it if more than half the class is willing After that I ll make arrangements with people asking if they can let someone borrow their skirt or pants I will also support requests so Emily can get in Kyle s pants Below is the chatterbox and I hope this can happen with your support Write your First name and whether or not you are willing to participate var chatterbox no urlLink target flooblechatterbox onClick window open about blank flooblechatterbox toolbar no location no directories no status no menubar no scrollbars yes resizable no copyhistory no width 480 height 400 return true align absbottom Talk in my urlLink flooble chatterbox a free javascript chat tag board shoutbox tagboard program for your xanga diary blogger or weblog urlLink logic puzzles brainteasers if chatterbox chatterbox ok document write This urlLink flooble chatterbox is document write temporarily unavailable It will be back up shortly

14	for some odd reason my mother yes my mother felt the need to discuss the cross dressing day with me and she thinks it would be funny but says we should do it if we do it at all on Tuesday because wednesday is the moving up ceremony and the acedemic awards thingy so people will be in full dress code mode and they might not approve 

14	We should totally do a cross dressing day While I fully understand about the whole uncomfortable to wear a skirt and problem with getting the right sizes things we should still do it becuase it would be really funny and no one s ever done it before 

14	New way of saying Spanish is dumb L Espagnol is deaf 

14	read the title i am in new orleans having a great time and it would be totaly awesome if we did have a cross dressing day but it has to be when i came back like tuesday or wendessday oh yes thank you for making people put titles and well blah copyright spork townsend 2004 not permitted to use with out written consent my owner under penalty of pokey 

14	You guys have to invite Ransom into the blog and this whole cross dressing thing is not gonna work for me I m all for a good joke but you know you ll never get it together and no one wants to see me in a skirt I mean come on 

14	Does anybody have a Spanish study guide 

14	ok so here s my thought since we have the awards ceremony on wednesday june 2nd it would be wise to be dressed in regular uniform for that event We however could switch dress codes on tuesday That was a good idea tori with going to the trift store because it would also be problematic if we didn t get our uniforms back in time for the awards ceremony on wednesday I don t know about the rest of you but i only own one kilt that fits me If anyone likes this idea please say so in your next blog 

14	From now on you have to include titles This is because otherwise it seems like you named your post something else For instance A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L Engle would be called It was a dark and stormy Doesn t work That includes you too Emily Combe 

14	My mom and I actually saw one of these the other day 

14	We could probably also borrow clothes from the thrift shop because come on how many of us are really going to fit into each others clothes 

14	Pieter i fully agree we should totally do that anyone who is all for switching uniforms put it in your next post I consider wednesday as the last day of school 

14	Anyone who s wondering I made up a name for my phobia caducus acer phoebia it means destined to die by tree s in latin Yeah this is gonna seem weird to most people but I had to post it for the people who will get

14	Hi you know you love urlLink Apple but only 1 of computer users use it Most of the 98 of urlLink Windows users say that they don t use urlLink Macs because of compatibility where only few of their beloved Windows programs are not usable on Macs I don t think that was among the things that bothered urlLink this man but he was definitely bothered Don t get me wrong that I dislike Apple Computers because I am about to switch as I like them more than windows machines but this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen This man speaks of his experience on the Mac very badly but it is funny because although he dislikes Macs he still uses them and even edited the video on a Mac urlLink Check it out here and enjoy 

14	i need a kit kat bar if anyone wants to me nice they can bring a kit kat bar into school tommrow and give it to me thank you and good bye 

14	clap at least someone is on my side I have nothing against Emily well for this argument at least but I just don t see what s she s adding to this blog she just screws everything up breaks all the rules and then does a stupid lie apology and does it again It s really not cool 

14	i take it i have been banned from speaking in hacker sayign i doubt anyof you can read hacker fluently knowing a few words is NOT considered fluent blah where did quiggy go anyway i miss him and emily the poll that tuck put up was mabye later if she breaks more rules and yes i personaly voted yes you have broken enough rules as it is 60 says mabye later its later we shoudl kick you out youve broken enough rules 40 thought we should have kicked you out a while ago quiggy we need your expert advice on this matter or your password so i can kick her out for now this is sporko reporting from SBC sporko brodcasting company 

14	Um Well For the time being yes but when Quiggy comes back I m going to have to get his opinion 

14	can i curse in 1337 

14	It s fine I know Quiggy did break his own rule but that was cause he had sort of well he freaked out frankly And we can use mild curse words if you really want to And of course you can curse as much as you want as long as it s in a different language For instance I frequently say bugger although that s just British slang not a different language And I am certainly going to miss you too And you And you Heck I ll miss all of you In other news I figured out what was messing the blog up and I fixed it so everything s back to normal although you might want to check out the sidebar for the updated rules I did some tweaking 

14	thanks dougie again I m sorry taco and quiggy and dougie I do not understand why we cannot use curse words seeing that quiggy broke his OWN rule by using the word and i quote fucking in one of his posts again I am sorry and i just wana keep this blog going as long as possible I m going to miss all you guys soo much next year 

14	Do you think maybe we could keep the fightin and the feudin to a minimum To Tucker Scroll down Emily apologized she had not read your post I at least am not going to kick her out Also as you are not an admin you don t set the rules although I would prefer mild swear words or badly misspelled ones cough urlLink danmmed cough to a constant stream of not so mild ones One other thing is we don t all always spell everything right I know I don t To Emily Tucker is right in that a proper respect for the rules should be maintained However as you did apologize I don t see any real problem To Quiggy Where the heck are you Quiggy This blog is succumbing to chaos There is looting and pillaging in the streets Somebody light the Quig signal We need you Quiggy 

14	how do you try to call me stupid and spell it wrong jeez thats just sad 

14	ok you re right about one thing Emily 66 7 percent voted to give you another chance and now you turn around and swear even more then do an annoying smarty jones post everything i asked you kindly not to do Well you just used your last chance someone please kick Emily out I m not trying to be mean but shes breaking every rule and grr I m done 

14	I am sorry i didn t not read the post made by tucker at 8 34am i will stop cursing even though matt vessey broke his own rule and I will use my own blog as my personal blog i don t want to make ppl angry or anything like that P S sorry taco 

14	i think ur poll is stoopid matt v broke his own rule of cursing so ya know what i dont give a fuck see it s a curse word here are some more fuck btich ass damn shit motherfucker haha ok ya well if u look at ur lil polly thingy you will see that it says that 66 66 vote for me to stay in and 33 33 vote to kick me out so hah btw SMARTY JONES WAS AWESOME and i also had a great hroseback riding lesson but that s besides the point hey taco i thought we had made a truse spelling ok well i gtg byeness 

14	I feel special the 100th post is here and I its Sporko an honored to put it up So I have to think of something meaningful for the 100th post on the blog of the damned puts on trucker thinking hat thinks well the trucker hat of knowledge hasn t helped me at all phui Well this was fun lets do it again sometime Whoever centered the whole blog quiggy should be brutally beaten my me it looks weird at least I think it does P S Everone should please put up post titles 

14	Meg everyone loves him her but nobody knows her real sexual identity That was all to change when we did a drive by of Sonoco s A plus Cimmie handed the slip asking whether she he preferred Coke or Pepsi which Taylor had recently typed up and after much speculation over the whole it s for a school newspaper alabi Meg filled out the form The first field was her name which we told him her was unnecessary to fill out so she left it blank Right below that field however was the most important field the gender question It asked wheter or not Meg was a girl or if she was a boy Taylor waited until we left A plus to read it And it read FEMALE I was shocked Meg is was will be a female I was convinced she was a he but I am starting to face reality and I can t wait to see Meg over the summer when I visit A plus Oh and P S Emily USE TITLES 

14	Have you ever had a craving to make your own song Get a laugh Eat some Chinese food No Well you need to go to this website to get some inspiration and a laugh but I don t think they offer Chinese food I am not going to ruin any surprises but it sounds pretty cool if you type in the only large field in the website I wont say what it s labeled I found this place not to long ago This is too much fun I know what I will do tonight Don t ask someone told me to do it and it the result is surprisingly good You wont regret clicking on urlLink this link Enjoy

14	Dear Emily needs a Comb I am posting this just to say that I m sorry if I did something that triggered that outbreak where you demanded that I leave this blog it is in my most heartfelt manner that I ask why you demanded that I leave the blog other than the fact that I stole sporko from you I can see no reason for you to hate me Because of that outburst I have decided to kill you with hugs and caring Thanks for your time Taco 

14	Hey someone tell me how make one of those brain eaty websites That would be awesome we should start tomorow 

14	And also Emily Tucker has as much right to be here as any one of us Same goes to you Carson 

14	quiggy you broke yor own rule of no swearing and i salut you for doing it and why does emily combe hate tucker so much whats up with that 

14	THIS BLOG WAS DESIGNED TO BE A BLOG FOR ALL MONTGOMERY SCHOOL 8TH GRADERS LAST TIME I LOOKED ALL OF YOU FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY IF YOU DON T LIKE IT THEN SUCK IT UP AND MOVE OUT OF THIS BLOG BECAUSE YOU FUCKING WELL DON T DESERVE IT 

14	First of all Dougie the abbreviations USB and CSB stand for United States of Blog and Confederate States of Blog not Universal Serial Bus and whatever the other one was Tonight the contest shall begin The one most important rule is that you MAY NOT MENTION THIS CONTEST ON BLOG OF THE DAMNED NO CHANGING IT IN ANY WAY Graaaagh 

14	mmh that was you i was sure it was dougie by the way if anyone is wondering witch i doubt anyone is i am on dougies side for the brain eating contest oh and another thing quiggy you have to add oogoly boogoly to the urban dictionary i wont because i am too lazy and it involves too much typing blah 

14	I can t believe you I came up with gunker not dougie nothing against dougie but I demand you change your blog now or or BLAH 

14	I just read the rules and saw that little rule thing my bad just ignore the post and don t kick me off 

14	Hey I ll do this brain eating thingy I call dougies side and Matt has to refresh his site so the hits he already has dont count also what do the team names stand for 

14	Doug and I will probably be heading the Brain Eating contest starting tomorrow night If you re interested please comment on this post stating which side you want USB or CSB and who you want for your captain Tomorrow night is the deadline 

14	blah well congrats tucker for joining the blog by the way i love quiggys idea for the brain eating contest i claim captain of one of the sides danmmed it all to hell 

14	Hey everybody it s Taco just saying that i finally got the stupid link to work and I m in and blogging 

14	I have a new idea quite possibly the best one yet We should split into two teams the United States of Blog and the Confederate States of Blog Each team gets their own blog Each team also gets their own Brain Eating account For one week each team tries to eat more brains than the other team You may affect B of D however the changes must be fixable Doug and I would be on seperate teams and would not make any new administrators or delete old ones Vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool 

14	If you like Bush don t click this urlLink link 

14	if you re desperately bored or have an addiction to voting in polls In case the previous sentence didn t tip you off the Blog of the Danmmed is proud to bring you another poll The results of the previous poll indicated that Quiggy and I are evil mutant lobster chickens which would explain why typing is so difficult Thank goodness for mail order helper monkeys 

14	Um yeah in case anyone is wondering why i dont answer calls and email its becuase im going to cali Oh yeah and when i come back my mom is making me be more socail and do a bunch of camps so if dougie or gabo or any of the other people in that art camp feel the need to include a struggling cartoonist into your little portait and landscape posse just post the info about the camp thanks 

14	Ok Dear Dopugie Ben Matt anyone who can help How do I post an image on a blog Gabo 

14	Hey Quiggy could you put up a link for Evan s my blog It s http rhythmsection blogspot com Thanks 

14	Well seeing as how the reaction seems to be a resounding thumbs down I will remove the post but I still think that the song is hilarious I sincerely apoligize to anyone who was offended If the admins care to warn me so be it Once again I m sorry 

14	That was the greatest concert I ve ever been to ever Ok Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs But STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started so they must be in thier late 40 s early 50 s or late 50 s but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment doing highkicks and seemed they were in their 30 s Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years The person who played the keyboard and did a lot of the lead singing is officially my new hero He s also really amusing Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said Well we know you can rock but can you rag time And he started playing rag time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing And all of Styx was steaming hot with their tight tight tight tight pants esp the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all and well I ll just stop there for all of your sakes STYX ROCKS 

14	Neon aka Evan I have a compromise If you never try to destroy BotD I am willing to have you have our members joining your urlLink blog so long as you never insult BotD s admins in an admin sense or try to destroy BotD If you agree send me an invitation to quiggy gmail com Cool 

14	HI YOU DONT KNOW ME BUT I AM ALAINA CARSON S GIRLFRIEND AM I SUPPOSED TO BE TYPING STUFF UP ON THS BLOG OH WELL I DONT CARE BUT ANYWAYS I AM ALAINA AND I LOVE CARSON 

14	all i have to say about everything today its purple y pink ish spork 

14	

14	jeez people i dont no who neon is im not trying to be mean just please tell me who it is i didnt no if he was a complete stranger or w e is he the one who posted on the crap on the chatterbox 

14	Tomorrow we are going to see The Terminal starting 5 00pm in the Downingtown 16 theater Come if you feel the need invite who you wish See you there 

14	Quiggy is not being oppressive he is discriminating accordingly So far in its virtual existence The Blog of the Danmmed has existed as a haven for Montgomery students now ex Montgomery students of course and he is merely sticking by the principles on which this blog was founded While in the future there may be exceptions to this you have not made an overly convincing case for yourself I hope that future animosity between the denizens of the BotD and yourself may be avoided and I do apologize if the current configuration of the BotD has caused you any distress However we are currently unable to fulfill your wish to join and as your present actions contradict any perceived desire you might have to join we do not see a possibility of a wish of that nature being fulfilled in the foreseeable future Once again I apologize for the inconvenience 

14	i dont no who u are but if you dont havent gone to montgomery you cant join there is nothing oppresive about that and no one things you should join especially if you keep being annoying on comments and the chatterbox 

14	Who is Neon and HOW THE HECK ARE DOUGIE AND I BEING OPPRESSIVE That new rule is already gone and was simply to try to catch who ever was making fun of people via the Chatterbox 

14	When are you going down to Stone Harbor 

14	I have been pretty bored this summer I have watched tv and played video games and sometimes gone to the pool Now that the public schools are out I will actually have someting fun to do 

14	The new rule is disbanded 

14	First of all I know who wrote the stuff on the Chatterbox It was Evan s brother Matt Evan and Matt are down in NC with me and that is my IP address He used Evan s laptop Because I revealed the evil not to say hilarious prankster we should not have the chatterbox post blog post rule If that rule stays in effect I will have to flood the blog again and remember how irritating that got I wil also flood the chatterbox just to get rid of the great prank messages 

14	Just so everyone knows I am temporarily enforcing a new rule if you post you must also enter a message into the chatterbox This is twofold it will help remove the offensive messages and it will help me catch the doer of these evil doings SHOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A MESSAGE I MAY ASSUME THAT IT IS YOU 

14	Attention everybody this is a public service announcement The chatterbox is completely rude and offensive Unless the person responsible comes forward they will be kicked out when they are discovered Should they come forward they will only recieve one warning Thank you 

14	hey guys this is Evan under Ben s username asking if I can join Twould be quite fun you guys have quite an operation going here Anyway have fun voting and the like

14	And it is when you look into that bright light at the end of the tunnel that you realize Oh God we are so fucked This is where we begin and end One bright summer afternoon when all is well birds chirping sun blasting it s radioactive death rays down onto us not an apocalyptic cloud in the sky everything can go awry in a matter of seconds Just when everything seems ordinary the extraordinary goes and gives you one giant wallop in the face A small child it could be any small child but let s just call him Billy was frolicking in his back yard when the sky opened up This is your extraordinary What happens when the sky opens up you ask Well let me tell you my children it is not a pleasant thing Your eyes boil and your skin melts then you are torn to shreds in a matter of nanoseconds The sky you see wants to fill this void and therefore needs matter to fill it This matter could come from anywhere typically it uses oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen that s floating in the air But this is different It wants Billy When the sky opens up it creates a giant BOOM which feels very much like being punched by a 15 foot novelty boxing glove This knocked him to the ground and allowed him to see this extraordinary event take place As he lay flattened on the grass unable to breath his vision began to go askew making everything bubble His eyes were indeed boiling soon they will become part of a soup formally known as his central nervous system At this very moment his skin became prickily and wet His skin was indeed melting soon to become a puddle on the grass Shortly after he was ripped into the vortex his body torn to bits then reassembled in whatever fashion it could be reassembled As he swirls through the atmosphere or rather lack of one he sees a bright light This is your light at the end of the tunnel He had always been told in church and by his parents that the light at the end of the tunnel symbolized hope This however is not the case in this situation Billy attempts to reach his hand up for that bright light only to hear the garbled tearing of muscle in the wind It has Billy His arm at least What is this bright light you ask Well interpret it as you wish This is up to you Billy s eyes started to water he knew it was the end When he reached that light it felt as though he had been reborn The purest water you can t even imagine washed over him cleansed his body and mind and restored him to his former self But for what He had been stranded in the middle of nowhere to die His light was some kind of hope but it was also his greatest fear and will cause his demise He walks And as he walks the world around him begins to form into something familiar It is at this moment he realizes what has happened He collapsed into himself But what kind of life is this He is alone in his mind and what will happen when his subconscious takes over This will have to wait for next time 

14	For the first time since the end of school I met up with Brandon and Sean to PK at Vincent Elementary and DAMN WAS IT AWESOME I got there about 20 minutes before everyone else and pk d some but really not a lot seeing as I feel tired AANYWAY I drilled monkey vaults and attempted some kongs which I still freak out on and dont put my legs through my arms Oh well Um we talked a lot and ate food some Then when Brandon got there we started going around the playground a little bit Much to my surprise I found that rolling on woodchips is not comfortable after a 10 foot drop they feel like little rocks digging into your spine So I went back to vaulting this little tube thing that was fun Then Sean came and we practiced wall runs stretched and did some flow activities I need to relax for a little bit but not moving for a day is rough I m addicted 

14	cider is falling up and the feathers are floating down 

14	First of all I m finally in the blog Second I had the strangest dream when I was in North Carolina I walked up to a bottle of aloe I said to myself Hmmm I wonder what this would taste like So I picked up a spoon and squirted some aloe into it I ate the aloe and it didn t taste too bad I kept eating and eating until I started to feel sick Then I read on the label do not consume aloe If you do drink lots of water but only if you live near a water tower If you don t the water could be contaminated with animal feces So that s it When I remembered the dream in the kayak place I remembered the taste and started feeling really sick It didn t help when Evan started showing me all of the aloe bottles 

14	I m back home from North Carolina WHEE Anyway hope everyone had as much fun while I was gone as I did We arrived on Topsail Beach Sunday morning after driving for 9 hours I believe and when we got in everything was clean and cool and oh so pretty So we wasted no time in getting unpacked then I went down to the beach with Trachtman and we flopped around in the waves for a good bit That s pretty much what we did On Monday we went downtown to get some ice cream play miniature golf go to the arcade which was sweet I had mint chocolate chip oh so tasty Tuesday More beach got sunburnt and then we went out for lunch I had onion rings and a grilled cheese sandwich God was that a mistake the onion rings decided to take baths in grease before I consumed them so that they could eat my stomach lining and render me useless for the rest of the day Ouch That night we played Spoons in which Mrs Trachtman and I were the victors Wednesday Stomach said Ok I killed the nasty grease and I was on my way I practiced front flips that day for a bit landed on my back a lot scraped my head once and hit my heels a few times Then we Tracht dogg Mrs Trachtman and I went to go kayaking but we saw some lightning and were instructed to turn back so we did and got a pass for a free hour of kayaking the next day Thursday I hung around at the house after waking up late waiting to go kayaking So we went around 11 00 and it turns out the tide isn t high enough for us to go out on the water and there s a group of 21 coming in later So we are instructed to come back around 4 30 We get back go down to the beach for a few hours and I come out really really really tired flipping over waves is fun So then we went kayaking finally for our full hour Only this time my parents came along So we got there and I found some nice nice shoes Merrell Chameleons droooolllll but they were 100 and I had already bought new shoes for PK And they didn t have any in a big enough size Blah Ok 1 hour of Kayaking I led the group most of the way it was a lot of fun and made me realize that I m actually in shape I wasn t tired by the end of it I was impressed Anyway it was great There were some fish jumping out of the water I m not sure what kind Ben you remember But it was pretty there was marsh grass and the water was only like 2 feet deep pretty neat Then we went home and played spoons again I didn t win Friday We went home Drove a lot Stayed at a hotel I got a sinus headache Couldn t fall asleep until 1 00 a m Saturday HOME WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE After a lot of driving we finally made it home It felt nice to get back into Pughtown and see my puppy hound and brother and everything It just felt so good I was home So I hung around a bit with Matt and read the new Newsweek then brought my stuff in After that I went out and PK d like a madman it felt wonderful My legs were dying to PK and when I finally did they just absorbed everything Cleared the 4 5 foot fence like it was nothing it felt fantastic Climbed up my porch and spun around over the rail then went inside I had missed that so much Then we went out for dinner and I ate food Now I am not hungry Then videogames Now I m on AIM wondering why music isn t playing Well that s it SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH 

14	Yay I m in in blog That was the greatest concert I ve ever been to ever Ok Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs But STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started so they must be in thier late 40 s early 50 s or late 50 s but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment doing highkicks and seemed they were in their 30 s Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years The person who played the keyboard and did a lot of the lead singing is officially my new hero He s also really amusing Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said Well we know you can rock but can you rag time And he started playing rag time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing And all of Styx was steaming hot with their tight tight tight tight pants esp the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all and well I ll just stop there for all of your sakes STYX ROCKS For more on the concert go to my other blog www thehopelesslifeofgabo blogspot com

14	I have discovered the only style of music I have any talent in singing is glam rock So expect some changes in my appearance I m modelling myself off of this picture 

14	Dougie and I have our pictures in the Mercury It s from graduation and there are a bunch of people mentioned and or pictured It s really nifty 

14	There s going to be a D D thing at my house this Wednesday It s going to be from 3 9 so there will be food Bring a bathing suit 

14	I thinking about having an extra D D session during this week It s either going to be on Monday tomorrow or Wednesday I m not sure which one It would probably be from 12 6 so we ll have real food this time You should also bring a bathing suit 

14	What do you guys think of the look of the blog Should I change it If so how I personally really like it the way it is this template is surprisingly attractive 

14	I created a blog for our D D group It s at urlLink I ll invite everyone who s in our group 

14	Rachel could you talk to RJ about making it so that the rest of our characters could be level 3 as well Seeing as how we don t have too much money except for Quig and Dougie and you have about 1000 I don t think it s very fair Also I think that it would benefit the whole group as well as individual players because Quig and Dougie would get more spells and stuff like that On a completely different note do you think that I should make a blog devoted specifically to our D D campaign And on another completely different note do you think it would be possible to have a D D sleepover at some point 

14	Doug I apologize for slapping you after you fainted when fighting that dragon Spork awesome job crossing that bridge Ben next time bring more changes of clothes By the way I have a question for the D D experts I was looking in my PHB and my feat Combat Casting says I should gain a 4 on my concentration checks My concentration is 6 with a 4 under ranks Should I add another 4 under Misc Modifiers Just a question
