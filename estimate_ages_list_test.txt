34	FROM THE DESK OF: Dr.Ouadrago Yamkine Issak, IBA INTERNATIONAL  BANK OF BURKINA FASO.

I have urgent and very confidential  business proposal  for you.An American Gold consultant/contractor with the burkina  faso west   African Solid Gold Corporation,mr  Morris Thompson made a numbered time  (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$10,000,000.00 (TEN  Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered  from his contract employers, the west African Solid Gold Corporation that  Morris Thompson died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight 261(for more  information about this crash and person you can contact this website: http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list since we got this information about his death. On further investigation, I  found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his  next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr  Morris  Thompson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. This sum of  US$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the  interest is being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever  come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic OF BURKINA  FASO,  at the expiration of 4  (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the burkina  faso  Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i am due to  retire from office next year 2007,  My proposal is that I will like you tp come in as a next kin/ foreigner to  stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government  officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and  address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and  affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.through the bank  attorney as soon as you put application to the bank.We shall employ the  services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL as  the  bank will approve you as  the next of kin and to obtain the necessary  documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the  transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then  facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75%  for me and 20% for you.then 5%will be map out for any expenses that may  occure during transactions. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be  done by the attorney as will employ him on  the approval of the bank; i am  notifying  you this as a secret of mine, as a senior bank officer.i knew all    what it takes  to get  this funds out of  the bank. and my position and  that of YOU  qarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

43	>From The Desck Of Mr Liow Hanoi Selangor Malaysia Email:liow_hanoi46@gawab.com  Attention: Sir/ Madam.  Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction,this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not an hoax mail and I urge you to treat it with seriousness. We want to transfer the sum of Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($9,700.000.00) to an oversea account from one of the banks located in Malaysia. I want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty A/C can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.  I am Mr.Liow Hanoi a personal account officer to late Mr Morris Anthony an INDUSTRALIST. During the course of auditing,it was discovered that since the death of this INDUSTRALIST no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds. So the bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This account was opened with the bank in 1998 and since 2002 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I discovered that my late client died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is an American and great industrialist who lost his life along with his family members leaving nobody as next of kin.  No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account. The total amount involved is Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$9,700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad,but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here,rather it will only be approved to a foreigner who has information about the account,which I shall give to you upon your positive response.  I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently.I need your strong assurance that you will never let us down, me and the key bank officials who are deeply involved with me in this business. I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money,leaving no trace to any place. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.  At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.  Please email me at: liow_hanoi46@gawab.com  Best Regards, Mr Liow Hanoi

My name is Mr.Joseph Taylor, son of Mr. Charles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia.   I have some money I would like to invest into your company, or where you do not want any investment into your company, I will need your assistance to make a credible investment in your country.   I will appreciate it if you could please  get back to me urgently as I have already moved  the money to Europe, and therefore, movement would not constitute any problem.   I look forward to your reply via this my private email address: joetaylor@mixmail.com   Best regards, Joseph Taylor     
41	Dear Friend,  I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics,  which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please  treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you  in the best of health.  I am Mr Denguele djaratigui, the manager of bill and  exchange at the  foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we  discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred  thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign  customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next  of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless    some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as   indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at  the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this  business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank  treasury as   unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained  unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank   treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you  as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for  expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.  Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this   fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or   next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account   number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should  contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,  Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Yours faithfully.  Mr Denguele djaratigui,  N/B: CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL OR WRITE EMAIL, E-MAIL: dengue_djara_1544@yahoo.fr TEL: +226-76-45-08-13.  _________________________________________________________________ Testez Windows Live Mail Beta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/

46	From: Mrs. Ngoni Elita Tawanda.  Dear friend,  WIDOW IN NEED.  Please don't be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do not know each other before . I am MRS.Elita Ngoni Tawanda,the wife of late Ndinonzi Kajengo Tawanda, a farmer in ZIMBABWE who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my husband, he made a deposit with a security company somewhere which I will tell you after I have received your positive response, The consignment was declared to contain GEM STONES shipped on diplomatic cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents. The actual content is the sum of US12.5 million (twelve million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars only). This was done when he noticed the looming danger in Zimbabwe on land policies. The security company does not know the actual contents of the boxes consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons. This amount was meant for the purchase of new Agricultural machineries and chemicals for our Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few rich black farmers alike. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my husband was one of the victims. It is against this background that, all my family members fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives. We are currently taking refuge in the Malawi where we sort political asylum. At this point, I have now decided to transfer my late husband’s money to a safe custody. All I want is to introduce you to the security company as the next of kin to my late husband, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could assist me without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have gotten. To the best of my knowledge, the Zimbabwean government had written their counter-part in Malawi to extradite me and my children to face the laws of the land. To the glory of God, the Malawian government has not yielded to this request because International Bodies are watching. We have been under close watch by the authority and the asylum we signed do not permit us to live country hence we cannot travel to take delivery. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his or her hands. I must let you know that this transaction is free from risk.

51	MR. SIMON WONG DAH SING BANK LTD. 19 DES VOEUX RD. CENTRAL HONG KONG, HONK KONG.  I am Mr.Simon Wong credit officer of the Dah Sing Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also ?discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.  Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy Communication and i will provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  Kind Regards. Simon Wong.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t  want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe  fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,  inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after  I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the  percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication  and location where in the money will be remitted .  On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by  email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials  confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the  payment Agency. I willbe handling official protocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as  I am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity.  Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my email address .  Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

34	  Dear Sir/Mandam,  I greet you in the name of GOD, the Beneficent, and the Merciful. Before I  introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail  and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer fund to overseas  account the sum of ($30,000.000.00 USD)Thirty Million United States Dollars)  from a Bank here in Nigeria West Africa. I want to ask you, If you are  capable to quietly provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new  Bank account immediately to receive this fund,even an empty account can serve  to receive this fund,as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for  this important business,trusting in you and believing in God that you will  never let me down either now or in future. I am Patrick Duru,I WORK WITH FIDELITY BANK PLC During the course of our  auditing last week, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the  bank in 1997 and since 1999 till date, nobody has operated on this account  again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that  the owner of the account died without a beneficiary to the account hence the  money is floating and if I do not remit this fund out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson of 61, of Fairbanks, Alaska  an American and a great industrialist,business leader and largest private  land owner resident of Fairbanks City Alaska State who unfortunately lost his  life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed,  including his wife(Thelma Thompson)and only daughter(Sheryl Thompson)leaving  nobody to claim the fund. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the  account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well  that the account is a secret account. The total amount involve is Thirty  Million United States Dollars only [$30,000.000.00]and I wish to transfer  this fund into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any  foreigner; I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this fund cannot  be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information  about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I  am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down  in this business,you are the first and the only person that I am contacting  for this business. So, please reply urgently so that I will inform you the  next step to take urgently. I need your strong assurance that you will never let us down, me and a key  bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I guarantee  that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that  will protect you from any breach of the law. The bank official will destroy  all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no  trace to any place. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal  approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate  clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total  amount, 60% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses both parties might  have incurred during the process of transferring.Furthermore, the transaction  is Risk Free, there is no risk involved and the utmost paramount of this  transaction is Secret and Confidential due to my 15 years of meritious  service with the Fidelity Bank Plc.Which I dont want to  jeopardize. Note that,all correspondence should be by phone and by e-mail,I will be  extremely happy if you can abide to my instructions, I believe the sky shall  be our limit and willing to invest in your area of specialization at the end  of this transaction. Feel free to contact me directly via my email address or  telephone. Thanks for your anticipated co-operation   Patrick Duru Fidelity Bank Plc Phone:2348026331325   You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site; http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list

66	Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed Birmingham,  United Kingdom. Email:  darfurefugee@yahoo.fr  Dear  Sir, Kindly Pardon me if this my letter would be an embarrassment to you for I am Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed, a Sudanese from the town of Kass in Southern Darfur writing you from Birmingham,  (United Kingdom), I am presently a Political Refugee in United Kingdom away from my native Country (Sudan), where there is a raging and devastating Civil war going on between the Southern Sudan Rebel Forces (Sudan People's Liberation Army) and Arab militias (Janjaweed)  supported by the Government Forces loyal of President Umar Hassan al-Bashir. Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989. The Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million, most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for "internally displaced people," and some crossing the border into Chad, where they live in refugee camps, straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes, killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees who have been impoverished, battered and displaced by years of Civil war in our lands. I am therefore using this medium to solicit for your assistance. Your contacts were obtained  by me during my search on the Internet for a reliable person that would assist us in claiming this money from the Secret Vault of a Financial Institution where it was deposited in a friendly Country  through the help of a sympathetic Senior Nurse attached to the Red Cross International Society some time ago, though the Nurse is late now as she died of Typhoid fever shortly after but there is a particular Financial Agent who would assist you in  claiming the money and using part of it to buy foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothing etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees.  I would send copy of a POWER OF ATTORNEY given to me by the Late Commander which I would send alongside copies of my INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT and a second Power of Attorney to you that would enable you claim the funds from the Financial Institution upon your agreement and readiness to assist us.  I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the TOP SECRECY this transaction requires, as I expect your positive response through this above Email address as my movement is presently restricted by law covering Political Refugees, though I might give you a telephone number later where you can talk with me. On receiving your positive response we hope to finish this transaction within one week as a lot of our people are dying from sicknesses, diseases and hunger.  Expecting  your URGENT Positive response and thanks in advance.  Yours  Sincerely, Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed  P/S. If you are not interested in assisting us, we beg you to destroy this letter so that it does not fall into wrong hands.

The problem that am having at the moment is getting a reliable and trusted person that will forward   his contact and also his full name and Identification then i will proceed by Sending a POWER of ATTORNEY to him and a release letter that will direct the Diplomatic Security Company to deliver the funds to you either by cash or by Bank Transfer due to the fact that the funds are deposited in cash.

If you can play the role by sending me your details such as follow:  Full Name: Contact Address: Phone Number: Any Form of ID:  I believe it will be wise enough for us to claim the funds instead of Leaving it for some group of staffs to share it within them self.

Fr.Richard David. A senior staff with the World Bank fact finding & special duties office.I am writing you this letter based on the fact that cool penny is better than millions of dollars means it's better for one to live and die poor honest man than a rich dishonest one.  I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organization and have arranged with an officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Joseph Cliff to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LEM-05-371) amounting to US$10 million. Why we did this is because according to information gathered from the Bank’s/security computer, you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment without success.  As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problem we feel you are having is that of interest groups. A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday.  Also we found out that some of the officials of the prostates have been extorting a lot of money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment gets to you.  The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get this box shipped to you I and the (COS) Yesterday went to this four courier companies DHL, Ems, FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped to you by courier, but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to understand that they  have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment.  This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine.  We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the materials. <N:B> we did not declare money because courier does not carry money.Today a friend of mine who is diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, which also has diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world.  I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bring in this consignment to you is an expact and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Notting to worry about.  After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organization I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier.  Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send our promise, we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.May God be with you as i wait for your response either through Fax or Email:  Feel free to call me if you will like us to discuses more on this. /TEL:  +221 4183317.  Yours Faithfully Rev. Fr.Richard David Director, Special Duties. UNI/BF..

ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with  his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about  the crash you  can visit this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision  of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable  the  immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first  to the  bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will be remitted.

32	>From Mr. Thompson J. Alber Dear Friend,    I sincerely hope that after  you read this mail you will respond to my call, let me start by  introducing myself my name is Thompson J. Alber. I am 70 years old, a  British living in West Africa. I am a businessman and own two companies  here in Ouagadougou, married with two children. My wife and two  children died in a car accident six years ago but before this happened  my business and concern for making money was all I lived for I never  really cared about other values in life but since the loss of my  family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families.     I  have been helping orphans in motherless homes, I have donated some  money to orphans in Sudan, America and some Asian countries. Before I  became ill, I kept some money, Ten million,three hundred thousand  dollars (US$10.3million) to be precise in a long term deposit account  in a Bank.    Presently, I'm in a hospital my doctor told me I have  prostate cancer that I have a few months to live. It is my last wish to  see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because so much of  my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends since my illness,  hence I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge  responsibility to any of them since the money in the Bank is the last  fund that I have left. Right now I am partially stranded in the  hospital due to the nature of my sickness so I am appealing to you to  help me collect the deposit from the Bank and distribute it amongst  charity organizations.    I would want you to use your discretion to  distribute the money and keep 20% of it for yourself. Feel free to  reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you might have  incurred during the process of collecting and distributing the money to  charity organizations. May the good Lord bless you and your family. if  you are interested to proceed with this project go ahead and forward  the below information so that I will instruct you on how to proceed: Your Full Names: Your Direct Telephone Number: Your Fax: Your  Occupation: Your Nationality: Your Age:   Please reply to this mail as  I can only communicate through my laptop which is by my bed, as soon as  I get the above listed information, I shall then give you the necessary  information you need to collect this money.   God bless you.  Mr.  Thompson J. Alber.

The owner of this account is Mr. Howard Sweeney, a foreigner, a miner and an  industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since  1993 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My  investigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and  that Mr.Howard Sweeney until his death was the manager Sweeney Coy.(pty).  SA. We will start the first transfer with six million dollars  [$6,000,000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your  side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your  account.  The amount involved is (USD 29M) Twenty Nine million United States Dollars  only. I want to first transfer$6,000.000 [Six million United States Dollar]  from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I  don't know any foreigner.  I am revealing this to you with believein God that you will never let me  down in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax  number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.  I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this  business proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank official whom is working in our  favour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which  you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our  physical arrival in your country for sharing.

49	   Dear Friend,        My Name is John Amane Clarke, managing director of Diamond Security & Storage Company here in Accra- Ghana. In my department, I discovered an abandoned consignment worth over sum of US$12Million dollars (Twelve Million US dollars) in file that belongs to our foreign customer,       LATE MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. Below is a website which I will appreciate you going through to read the information.       http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm      Since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all effort has proved abortive.      The reason why I am contacting you is based on trust to enable me present you as the next-of-kin to him so this consignment will be released to you for safety and subsequent disbursement.       Nobody has come to our company for claiming of the consignment.       It will be easy to convince the company since I am in possession of the necessary legalised documents that backs-up the consignment and which will present you as the rightful next-of-kin to the deceased customer. I don't want this consignment to go into company,s treasury as unclaimed bill.       The company laws and guidelines stipulates that if such consignment remains unclaimed after seven years, the company will confiscate it.       The request for a foreigner as next-of-kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that late ANDREAS was a foreigner and any indigene cannot stand as next-of-kin to a foreigner.      All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I agree that 25% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of your assistance , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction, another 5% to help the less privilege and to assist the charity organisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 65% will be for me.       Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate release of this consignment, you must apply to the company as the relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your complete information, complete name, postal address, occupation, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the consignment will be release to.       Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the Application you will send to the company to seek the release of the consignment to you. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required Arrangements have been made. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail. My email address i: johnamaneclarke1@aim.com     Or you can send your number for me to call you.

This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address.I got your address from the South Africa information and word online.   During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers,he ordered all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers.   My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm,killing my father and made away with a lot of items in my father's farm.   Before his death,my father had deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg,South Africa the sum of US$6.5 million {Six million, five hundred thousand united state dollars}.After the death of my father,we decided to move to the Republic of south Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as valuables.   So, i decided to contact overseas firm and companies that will assist me to move this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any account within South Africa.We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance,5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and family to invest in your country.   All I want you to do is to furnish me with your direct telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.You can contact me on the above Tel number.

30	   >From . Mr. Simon Robson.  Kindest Attention:   My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich,I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused onmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.   Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use it to help those in Need.   N/B: Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.   I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.  Reply to this E-mail address if you are interested ( simonrobson04@web2mail.com )  God be with you.  Mr. Simon Robson.

66	From;Mrs Aminatu Abubaka Dearest. I am Mrs Aminatu Abubaka Arikama,  from Sierra Leone republic, residing in  Cote d'Ivoire. I am married to  Mr Abubaka Arikama, who deals in Cocoa and Gold business in Cote d  Ivoire for twenty five years before he died in the year 2002. We were  married for twenty years God give us a son, his name is Abubaka Arikama  Jr who is 17 now, and because of my husband love to me he refused to  marry another wife. He died after a brief illness from food poison  which lasted for only four days. Since his death I decided not to  remarry or get another child outside my matrimonial home, my husband  relatives was responsible for his death because they want to inherit  the entire legacy, I was ill and my son is still a little boy. Before  the death of my husband he deposited a huge amount (US$11.8M) in a  finance house here in Cote d Ivoire, Since my Doctor told me that I  have a little time left (about Six months) due to cancer problem.  Having known my condition and I can not survive this cancer illness,  and I don't want to lose my only son, I decided to transfer this fund  and my son out of this country. I took this decision because I don't  want to lose every thing my husband has worked for, and my husband  relatives are not even good at all because they are responsible for the  death of my husband in other to have all his properties and I don't  want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his  death and they will still kill my son if they have the opportunity. The  fund transfer will base on the option you prefer, (1) bank to bank  transfer (2) through a diplomatic channel to your address, the finance  house is ready to transfer the fund with any of the option we agreed  on, as soon as I receive your reply of accepting to help me I will give  you all the details including your percentage for assisting me in this  legitimate transaction.

I  sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this may seem like a complete  intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of  communication. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but  please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of  humility.    I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship. I am Mr. Dezaryi, the personal  account officer to the great late diseased who has an account in one of  the top banks here in South Africa. The account was opened in 2001 and  he died in 2004 without a written or oral WILL and since 2004 nobody  has operated on this account again hence the money is floating and if I  do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing and Govt. of South Africa will confiscate the funds for their personal  use which I personally don't want such incident to happen being that  this is a great opportunity for me.    My contact is for you to please  assist me to transfer the fund ($172,654,000.00 USD) One Hundred &  Seventy Two Million Six Hundred And Fifty Four Thousand United State  Dollars from a Cooperate Bank here in South Africa to an oversea  account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this  transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly  confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude. I  solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your  safe account for onward investment.   You can either provide us with an  existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long  as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business  trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either  now or in future because this business is my life. The owner of this  account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or  anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until  his death he was the manager of the company. My investigation through  the National immigration department & Ministries here proved to me as  well that he was single as at the time of his entry into the Republic  of South Africa. The amount in this account is USD ($172,654,000.00  USD) Two Hundred & Twenty fifty million United States Dollars} only.   As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for  investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the  management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give to you immediately, if  you are interested to do this business with me. There is no risk in  this business. With my position and my personal contact with the  manager of the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you  can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our  physical arrival in your country for sharing.  We will start the first  transfer with Fifty million [$50,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the  payment of the remaining balance of $122,654,000.00 Million to your  account. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to  any foreigner who has the correct information of the account, which I  will provide for you. So you should provide me with your correct account details where you will like the fund to be transferred to, or  you can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is  ok. At the conclusion of the transfer you will take 45%, 6% will be for  any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business and  the remaining 49% will be for me. As soon as I hear from you and upon  your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes  into your account I will then start the processing of the transfer of  the fund to your account without further delay.

37	SUPPLY FROM MR KONAN ALAIN  Abidjan.Cote d'Ivoire.  Attn:The President  Dear Sir,  I write to solicite your assistance and support to enable me execute a  very  lucrative and high profiting business transaction.I am very  sure that with  trust and understanding,we will be able to execute this busines to our  mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down the  trust I am  willing to repose in you.  I work for an Ivorien based import and export firm ("a-MIC"), I work product  sourcing manager. Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar  was held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I  was opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of  ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan  accomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part  of the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is  one of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in  this part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a  particular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that  he buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys  to the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find  out if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering  the  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market   which is affecting his business.  Back in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to  handle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and   discovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE  for $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY &  CATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of  which  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement  with my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each  supply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the  receipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to  give me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its  lowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences.  However, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him   with 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the  oppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer  of this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will  pay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me  that he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now  waiting for me to link him to the producer of the vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell  at  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down  payment of  50% of our quoted price first.  If you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my  behalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree  on the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the  contacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI  NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and  we  should never allow him to know the contact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal  directly with them.  Thanks for your cooperation. Yours sincerely,  MR KONAN ALAIN  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Dear Partner,  (TOP SECRET)  I am DR WOMA LEE, the manager in charge of auditing and accounting section of Africa Development Bank.AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa ,with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .  During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr.Andreas Schranner who who died with his wife and their only daughter on July 2000 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.  The said amount was U.S $10.150M ((Ten million one hundred and fiftythousand US dolloars)). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internation search in Burkina-faso here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.  Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.  I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 60% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep "top secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoraing the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. Trusting to hear from you. you can contact me through this number(226 76440063).

Since then, I  have made several  enquiries with his country’s' embassies to locate  any of my clients extended relatives.  After several unsuccessful  attempts, I decided to personally contact you with this business  partnership proposal.    The deceased had a deposit valued presently at  Eighteen Million United states dollars and the company has issued me a  notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary.

56	 dear friend, I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. I am writing, following the impressive information about you through one of my friends WORKS WITH THE BURKINA  CHAMBERS firm.  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $U.S15.5Million dollars (fifteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars)  in an account that  belongs  to one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in November 2004  in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking  guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next  of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidling here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact  that the customer was a foreigner  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect  to the  provision of a foriegn account, 10% will be set aside for expenses occured during the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according  to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch  -free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you recieve this letter. Yours faithful Bill & Exchange Manager.

33	Good day,  I am Mr. Kevin Garforth,staff of Cater Allen Private Bank. I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago.I Would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2002, the subject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.  I was the officer assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector then, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed.I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over Two million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.  In mid 2003, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited with the security firm.  The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th of November 2003.In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of that particular portfolio.This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.  I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of Cater Allen.Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne, in Southern part of France.We were soon enough to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.   Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a testate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased.  My present official capacity as the Head of Finance dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means,is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, The Security Firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Cater Allen, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to Cater Allen.This will result in the money entering the Cater Allen accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division.  This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those that occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is Six Million dollars deposited in a security firm, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my Bank  is concerned.  The transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to the security firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The security Firm has no single idea of what�s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that come forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.  My proposal:I now seek your permission to present you  as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you the beneficiary to the funds $6,000 000 00 (Six Million United states Dollar) ; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share the money with you. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 60/40.I would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit.I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days.   I will simply inform Cater Allen of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased. I will then officially communicate with The Security Firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have The Security Firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from The Security Company. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the consequences of this proposal.I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.  Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector.I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good  conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny.  These chances won�t pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a luck that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let�s share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion.  I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this instruction religiously.  Please, again, note that I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.  Mr. Kevin Garforth.

My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe. You will read more stories about President Mugabe's brutal acts by visiting this web site:<http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html>  My father was accused of assisting the White farmers in fighting the government. Few weeks after his arrest, he was reported dead. The government claimed he died of heart attack and his body was never seen for proper autopsy, they buried him in the government cemetery. My father's associate Mr.Mc Graw Olds a White farmer from Britain assisted me in fighting my father's death through the Court and media.  The Government saw us as a big threat to them and decided to eliminate us. Mr. Olds was attacked and murdered in his House, but fortunately, before they came looking for me, I received the news and I left the country through the border to save my life.  Here is my reason for contacting you.

All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost  their lives along with the driver.  Since then I have made several enquiries in his Embassy to locate any of my  client's extended relatives.After these several unsuccessful attempts,as a  matter of fact,I decided to trace his relatives over the internet in order to  locate any member of his family for a huge sum of fund deposited on his name  in an offshore financial company overseas but that was to no avail, hence I  decided within myself to contact you as his supposed relative since you are  also a foreigner to avoid the offshore company from confiscating the deposit  for theirs .  Please, I want you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my  client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the UBN  Finance company offshore payment centre where these huge deposits were lodged.  He had an deposit valued at about US$12M(Twelve Million US Dollars)and now  the finance company has issued me an urgent notice to provide the next-of-kin  or have the account freezed within the next ten official working days.  This was the last fund moved by my late claim to the offshore payment company  of UBN for sefety by the oil merchant shortly before the autocrash that took  his life and all in the car.This was as a result of the conflict emulated  from the annulled june 12 presidential election by the military dictatorship  Gen.Ibrahim Babangida which resulted to the death of many people in Nigeria  even chief Moshood K.O Abiola that won the presidential race.

45	RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear.Sir         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia. Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia. It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question. This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government. And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003. Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money. So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type. I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture. Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.  Best regards,  Mrs.Atiya Mohameed      
54	MY MESSAGE FOR PEACE AND HARMONY  Dear brothers & sisters,  We all need to pray for one another, and to love one another. We should always pray for the safety, peace, love and brotherhood for people all over the world. Too bad we can't have an independence day for the entire world. A day of freedom from ignorance, hatred, war, illusions, power and control. A day where we can all love each other as human beings and toss away the weapons of war, and cast out our fears and hatreds from our hearts into the graves. We must mourn the graves of the innocents all over the world, and give the children of the world the hope of a peaceful, loving and beautiful world.   A world full of love and without hatred or fear. A world where we can join hands together and accept one another, regardless of our skin color, ethnic divisions, religion or nationality. If we don't unite as a human race, then we have condemned the future generation of children a dark and very grim future.   Think of love, compassion and peace always...   MY PRAYER  FOR  PEACE AND HARMONY  Merciful God, You made all of the people of the world in Your own image and placed before us the pathway of salvation through different Preachers who claimed to have been Your Saints and Prophets. But, the contradictions (made by us) in the interpretation of Your teachings have resulted in creating divisions, faith based hatreds and bloodshed in the world community. Millions of innocent men, women and children have so far been brutally killed by the militants of several religions who have been committing horrifying crimes against humanity and millions more would not be butchered by them in the future, if You guide and help us find ways to reunite peacefully.  IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL, look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the controversial teachings of arrogance, divisions and hatreds which have badly infected our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; reunite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish Your purposes on earth; that, in Your good time, all nations and races could jointly serve You in justice, peace and harmony.  (Amen)  Regards, S.A.Rehman Peace Activist PAKISTAN   DPMWEZIPYDKMNBHUSZGJFSMYQKMKJEGMWVBJHO   
44	My Dear,  When I picked up your contact, I have this interest in going through your profile though not enough in giving me your detailed information to access your capability of a cordial relationship. But after going through your  profile with due deliberation, I deem it wise to contact you directly and seek your assistance in a business dealing that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. Though not minding the consequence but hoping that you would understand the complication on my side and the need for your kind assistance. Please excuse the manner of approach. But I think it is more convenient and discreet to contact you through this means.  I am interested in a partnership investment programme with yourself/corporation. There is this huge amount of ($9,245,000.00) which my late father kept in a security/financial firm before he was assassinated by government mercenary on 22 February, 2002, during a political crisis in my country- Angola. This fund was stashed in a security vault in Senegal, out of  foresight for a likely situation which I and my family found our selves then.  My father - Late Mr. Karim Fab deposited it as a family treasure and that was before his death. Now I and sister have left Angola to Dakar in the Republic of Senegal, through the help of my late father's loyal friend. Meanwhile, we are staying here with refugee status, instead of going to exile and we have decided also to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside my country Angola and the whole of Africa  for security and political reasons. We would want you to assist us to retrieve and transfer this fund to your country for safety and investment purposes.  If you are willing to render this service to us, we shall adequately compensate you with 25% of the total figure. We will arrange all the necessary procedures in ensuring a smooth process for the transaction. We will also  appreciate if you contact me once you receive this mail to enable megive you more details and modus operandi concerning the business.  This matter requires your urgent attention, confidentiality and discretion no matter what your decision maybe.  Thank you and God bless you.  Yours Sincerely,  Mr. Bill Karim & Sister . billkarm222@yahoo.fr     
67	Hello  This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i  decided to contact you through this medium.  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the  U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has  defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.   I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know  that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this  world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties  and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,  England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.  I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation.   I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital.   Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you.   If you can help respond back to me on my private email: razaqin01@yahoo.es   You can call me on: 44-785-258-3060  but not all the time the doctor will allow me to pick my phone calls.

In the capital city of Cotonou Benin republic, and assistance, this is a very confidential proposition for you. On April 21st 1999, A Swedish Oil consultant/contractor with the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr.Soren Anderson made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity on November 20th 2003 as his Credit Officer, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Soren Anderson died on auto accident with his entire family.  Further investigations and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. Again, I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Soren Anderson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$15,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics, codes and Laws, at the expiration of 7(Two) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Soren. This is simple, I will like you to respond immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and some of my colleagues who are aware of this transaction and 25% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by my colleagues and with my position as the Foreign Remittance Director guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

I pray that this email reaches you  in the best of health.  I am Mrs will dera ahmed, born melika diouf, banking profession, mother of  three children  the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank  Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M  (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that  belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in  the 2000 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next  of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless    some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as   indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at  the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this  business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank  treasury as   unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained  unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank   treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you  as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for  expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.  Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this   fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or   next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account   number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

57	DEAR BELOVED,    I am Mrs. Christina Holden.  Am married to Dr. Donald Holden. a Canadian who worked for Shell Oil Company in Nigeria,he died after a brief illness that  lasted for only four days. Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a child and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible forbids.    When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million  (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank. Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the RESERVE FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Three(3) months due to my cancer problems.   Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known  my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a  Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am  going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use thisfund on,  orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit  this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want  my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't  want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.  Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.    As soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal  information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your  telephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he  will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be  transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your  country.  I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as  the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want  you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my  shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund  when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a  life of a worthy Christian.   Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and  truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me  room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated  herein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.    Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.  Yours in Christ,   Mrs. Christina Holden.     
37	FROM:ROSLIN MATHEW ABIDJAN-COTE D'IVOR FROM:ROSLIN MATHEW  PLEASE MAIL BACK  My Dearest ONE May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I  needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help.  I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any  manner compel you to honour against your will.  I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am  ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr.  and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl.  My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who  operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.  It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of  his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004.  Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and  since then my father took me so special.  Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied  him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven  hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the  leading security company.  He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally  issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of  all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company .  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know  what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o  f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father  actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble  assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly  regarded.  Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter?  2. Can I completely trust you?  3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you  after the money is in your account?  Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.  Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

Justin an Attorney at Law, a South African national practicing here in the UK.  I am writing to notify you of the TESTAMENT of one or our Client who unfortunately lost his life in the Madrid bomb blast on March 11, 2004, killing over two hundred people including tourists in Spain. He was a prominent business leader who had been in Spain for vacation with his wife and their only daughter.   The deceased who was residing in the United States of America before his death made a deposit of Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$15,500,000.00) in Amsterdam Netherlands, his effort to avoid the obligatory payment of income tax in the United States of America.  However, I was mandated by our team of professionals to search for the relatives of the deceased regarding his deposit as the holding financial institution wants him to come forward for the endorsement of the reinvestments documents on interest accrued.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his Next of Kin or relatives to come over to sign the reinvestment documents or claim his deposit because the financial institution cannot release these funds unless a formal application is made which is in line with the Royal Dutch law on inheritance claim.  Regrettably, I learnt that his supposed Next of Kin, which could be his spouse or his only daughter died along with him in the ugly Madrid Bomb Blast leaving nobody with the knowledge of this huge deposit except me as the personal lawyer attached to monitor his deposit. It is in this regard that I and my colleagues decided to solicit your assistance by presenting you as the next of kin to the deceased. Although, we have agreed on the following sharing ratios: 25% for your assistance and 75% for me and my colleagues but it is still negotiable.  NB: This transaction is very confidential and 100% risk free as I have a copy of his LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT which I can present your name as the TRUSTEE & EXECUTOR. This transaction shall be executed under legitimate and legal procedures that will protect you from any breach of the Law.  Therefore, do not hesitate to revert back to me, either via fax or email, with the following details if my proposal interests you:  A signed copy of this letter, your address and your telephone and fax numbers.   Best regards,    Caspar J. Justin Attorney At Law (Principal)

Dear friend ,  I am the manager of bill and exchange at FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.AFRICA  DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)I am writing, following the impressive information  about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm in your  country. He assured me of your capability and releability to champion this business opportunity.  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten  Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a  plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make  this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here  stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the  bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in  this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my  colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for  more explanations.

59	Dear  Please let this letter not to bring confusion to you. I  know that we have not met either before but hear me from  the dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made to  send this to you.  I will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a  year ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in  business. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he  entered an agreement with my mother's brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mother's interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the company's lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the company's document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am  contacting you.  I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations,  They have named me all source of names even calling me  outcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement  she made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.  Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted  to her company's costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don't want the bank to know that my mother  is late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.  (1).I want you to provide an account where the money will  be remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Make  arrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible (3).How much commission you will take for rendering the  assistant?  My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only  child while she was having an affair with the person that  surpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the  man abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to  remain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father  for a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I  don't have any one to run into. All the members of my  mother family have turned their back on me because I  demand for me right. They told me that I don't belong to  the family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom  I don't know. I have made trace to know my father without  sucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your  heart and accord me this help.  God will bless you for saving my life and future.  Best wishes, Miss Joy Kem.

54	X-Mailer: popper  Season's Greetings!    Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a   surprise and may offend your personality for contacting you without   your prior consent and writing through this channel.I got your contact   from a professional database found in internet while searching for a   reliable and honest person that will be an anointed steward in a vision   very dear to me.    I am Mrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos person from Puerto Rico   undergoing medical treatment. I am married to Dr.  Kevin Jose-Carlos   who was a gun runner supplying arms and ammunition to warring factions   in Africa before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven   years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for   only four days. Since his after death, I decided not to re-marry or get   a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late  husband was alive he  deposited the sum of  £ 11.8.Million (Eleven Million,  Eight Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) with a Fiduciary company.   Presently ,this money is still with the Fiduciary Company. Recently,   my doctor told me that I would not last for the next  three months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my partial  paralysis. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an  organisation or individual that will utilize this money the way I am going  to instruct here in. I want an organisation or individual that will use this to  fund, women and youth groups, victims of war, environmental protection,  charities, orphanages and widows . It is said that blessed is the hand   that giveth.    I took this decision because I don't have any child that   will inherit this money and as a part of restitution for the atrocities   of my husband which I tacitly supported. I don't want a situation where   this money will be used in an ungodly manner , hence the reason for   taking this bold decision.    I am not afraid of death, hence I know where I am going .I know that I am  going to be in the bosom. If you consider yourself adequately equipped morally and  spiritually for this mission, please ,respond by letting me know your  decision to alondracarlos@sify.com    Yours sincerely,    Mrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos         
45	 Dear friend,  I am a staff of Private Banking Services at the Bank of China (BOC). I am contacting you concerning our customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago.  I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.  In 2002, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.  I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.   In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I informed him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incident of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available.   I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 9th October 2004.  In January this year, we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit , and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of china. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed.  The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.  In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. The investigation did not ever yield any result My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.   This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to BOC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to BOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have my way.  What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as BOC is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process.  They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.  My proposal;  I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction for the release of the  deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.  I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer I will then officially communicate with the  firm  and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.  We can fine-tune this based on our interactions.  I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move.   Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.  If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.  Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, send me your response on this email fsh1953@yahoo.com.cn to enable us commences this line of discussion.  Best regards,  Shang Fulin

70	Hello  This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the  U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has  defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.   I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know  that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this  world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties  and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,  England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.  I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation.

67	My dear. greetings from miss Fatoumata Saleeby. I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.  I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003. The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.  The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.  The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.  Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.  My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.  Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.  Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance. Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.  I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.  with best regards Fatoumata Saleeby. v     
50	-- Dear Beloved in Christ,  Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it as I know we don\'t know each other.It\'s my belief that I am doing the lord\'s bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in my heart.   It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and glory upon my life.   I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the completion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come over. Presently, I\'m in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this responsibility to any one of them any more.    I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA except, that I know that the lord\'s way are not our ways. I have come to conclude that\'s it\'s divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It\'s all part of the big picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend forever............   Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money and my husbands’ relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my husbands’ hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husbands’ relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my husband\'s wealth and not my health.   With God all things are possible.   Your Sister in Christ, Mrs. Sandra White. sandrawhite1950@excite.com sandrawhite1950@yahoo.co.uk       ________________________________________________  Message sent using Postan 1.0      
38	MY MESSAGE FOR PEACE AND HARMONY  Dear brothers & sisters,  We all need to pray for one another, and to love one another. We should always pray for the safety, peace, love and brotherhood for people all over the world. Too bad we can't have an independence day for the entire world. A day of freedom from ignorance, hatred, war, illusions, power and control. A day where we can all love each other as human beings and toss away the weapons of war, and cast out our fears and hatreds from our hearts into the graves. We must mourn the graves of the innocents all over the world, and give the children of the world the hope of a peaceful, loving and beautiful world.   A world full of love and without hatred or fear. A world where we can join hands together and accept one another, regardless of our skin color, ethnic divisions, religion or nationality. If we don't unite as a human race, then we have condemned the future generation of children a dark and very grim future.   Think of love, compassion and peace always...   MY PRAYER  FOR  PEACE AND HARMONY  Merciful God, You made all of the people of the world in Your own image and placed before us the pathway of salvation through different Preachers who claimed to have been Your Saints and Prophets. But, the contradictions (made by us) in the interpretation of Your teachings have resulted in creating divisions, faith based hatreds and bloodshed in the world community. Millions of innocent men, women and children have so far been brutally killed by the militants of several religions who have been committing horrifying crimes against humanity and millions more would not be butchered by them in the future, if You guide and help us find ways to reunite peacefully.  IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL, look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the controversial teachings of arrogance, divisions and hatreds which have badly infected our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; reunite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish Your purposes on earth; that, in Your good time, all nations and races could jointly serve You in justice, peace and harmony.  (Amen)  Regards, S.A.Rehman Peace Activist PAKISTAN

35	RE: COLLECTION OF FUND (US$25,000,000.00) UNDER SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.   Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big  transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious  considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today.    However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face  to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the  world today not being sure of your reaction.   I am Jones Martin, a  Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese  Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company  in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for  termination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and  the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid  payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of  US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS).    A special  arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with  Japanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to  terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with  an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they  prepared and handed over to The banker.   I was directly involved, well  paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was  withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault  delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.   The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was  delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for  the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys  were all handed over to me.   Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was  planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when  the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster  which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me  devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit  details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change  which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was  lost.  Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been  calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection.  Since then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these  consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came  across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been  well organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very  confidential.   Signify your interest by getting back to me via my  email as soon as possible.   Regard,  Jones Martin

42	FROM THE DESK OF  DR. JERRY BERRY THE MANAGER OF AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPT, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA-FASO.  I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE.  I am DR. JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned  sum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with  account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who  died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read  more about the crash on visiting this site  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery  that I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank  to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will  send to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this  money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years  and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered  to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know  that the money is not transfered into our treasure.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabé cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering  you 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other  charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the  remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of  the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for  this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I  will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free  and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have  been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail through the above email.  PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY  YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT  REQUEST.  Yours Faithfully, DR.

Attention: The beneficiary,   Dear Sir,   Re: Payment  Instruction for your outstanding claim.    For succinct introduction, I am Dr. Henry Salami of the above named Section of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN). The presidency has mandated the Audit Section to handle all foreign Contract awarded and commissioned since 1995 till date. Based on that your file has been forwarded to my office for review and subsequent payment to those contracts that was genuinely awarded and commissioned.  Based on the review carried out on your claim, I discovered that the claim you are laying was grossly over-invoiced and inflated to that magnitude by some officials who contacted you to provide an account to receive the fund simply because the code of conduct bureau does not permit civil servants to run or operate foreign account. You are presented to receive the fund as the beneficiary.   I have discovered that at no time did you execute any contract for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that you are contacted by some officials who presented you as the beneficiary just because Contract payment falls within their area of jurisdiction. Their aim is to divert the fund for you all to share mutually. I discovered and decided to contact you though you might find it difficult to believe but it is just the hard truth and so much money has been spent in these matter.    I am contacting you just for one reason that the fund can still be paid if I recommend because my discovery has not be revealled to anyone yet and I don't want to cancel the payment outrightly because it will not go down well with you. I want to let you know that the fund can be paid if you are ready to follow my advise and work secretly with me due to the fact that I have interest in the fund . I want to benefit from it, so let me know what will be my share out of it then I will go ahead and correct the anomalies and your past mistakes for the fund to be paid to you in seven working days.I am writing you with the spirit that you have seen that this is the truth but it will be very difficult to believe. As an Auditor attached to the Presidency, I am interested in the fund and I will like us to do the business together then I will write a favourable report about the claim for the immediate release of the fund or I will put up a report that will lead to the total cancellation of the payment. I know you have lost much money in Lobbying the officials to get the approvals.  At the precise moment, the claim has been processed, we are irrevocably mandated to debit the Federal Government account.I  will be expecting your call urgently on my direct No. +234 802 6944656 for us to discuss verbally for it might interest you to note that seven working day from the moment you acknowledge the receipt of this mail and agree on my terms will be enough to confirm the fund in your account provided you abide by my rules and also maintain the confidentiality of the transaction to avoid anything that will discredit my reputation.  I advice you discontinue any further communication with any other person for us to proceed in concrete fashion.

68	Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone  + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number  + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith , deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB  Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00,  (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we  discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his  holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out  that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin  was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry  Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for  Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at  the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of  the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes  though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I  tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because  I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign  account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company  so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is  simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so  that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in  place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me  and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address  upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like  houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we  can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.  TONY SMITH

69	Date: 08/01/2007  From: Assistant Director           International Remittance Department           ABSA Bank Limited           South Africa.  Dear Sir,  URGENT BUSINESS DEAL  I would like to start by introducing myself as Mr. Gill Mbabane the  Assistant Director of the above-mentioned department in the ABSA Bank of  South Africa. I have been directed to contact you urgently on a very  important confidential deal, which needs immediate attention. The decision  to contact you was based on the fact that we trust your capability to  receive on our behalf a sum of US$8,450,000.00 (Eight Million Four Hundred  and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars).  This sum in question was a credit balance of a Foreigner, an oil  Merchant/Contractor, a Geologist by profession and a Miner at KRUGER GOLD  COMPANY LTD who died since AUGUST 6, 1997 in [Korean Air Flight 801] with  the whole passengers onboard. And for your perusal you can view this web  site: http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list.  This credit was  held with our banks here in South Africa and the Director of  Account/Operations approached us since he cannot transfer this fund alone  without going through us (i.e. The International Remittance Department).  With our position and experience, we have worked out the modalities in such  a way that the transaction will take seven bank working days to accomplish.  On the receipt of your approvals, I will be in a very good position to give  you details on the agreed sharing ratio.  This may come as a surprise to you but as we progress, I will be able to  explain to you how I got your contact. Meanwhile, we are 100% positive that  you can handle this therefore, contact me on +27-837466810 or E-mail:  gillmbabane@yahoo.com as soon as you receive this urgent message.  I am anticipating your urgent response while thanking you in advance for  your understanding and co-operation.  Yours sincerely,  Mr. Gill Mbabane  _________________________________________________________________ Discover the magic of RSS feeds at MSN South Africa! http://za.msn.com/

I am James Nimely ,the son of the late Mr.Steven Nimely from Republic of Liberia.My father was a prosperous Gold and Diamond merchant in Monrovia,capital of the Republic of Liberia.  My family was attacked by unknown assassins ,my mother and sister died instantly but my father died after five days in a private hospital.

You shall be entitled to a significant portion of the fund..  Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss the modalities of this transaction.

I inherited a total sum of twenty one Million five hundred thousand American dollars from my late husband, the money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and was deposited with a security company in Abidjan Cote D Ivoire, in secretly  safe keeping in the trunk box that was because I needed a maximum security/ safety of my consignment and no body know about it even the government organization can  never trace  where about of the money until I am ready and prepare to claim it. but the Security company didn't know the real content of the box,   because it was deposited as a family valuables. My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the trunk box to any address that you think is very secure and save in your country for onward lodgement in your account for the purpose of future investment with your percentage of which we shall talk of it. I will send you the Authorization Certificate to call them in my next mail which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave me on the very day when the box of money was deposited under their security company. I give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear from you for quick conclusion of this transaction.The percentage will be your reward for all your moral and financial assistance during the period of moving the trunk box to your country.You are therefore requested to furnish me through my e-mail address You can reply to my pravite email ( lacson_alice2004@yahoo.com.ph )   Thanks and I look forward to your urgent message.     Mrs Alice.

51	      Friend in the Lord,    Please use this money for the churches and less privileged.    Greetings to you and your family in the name of God. In my search for a reliable and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers and painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help in carrying out my last wishes. My name is Mrs.Marvis Smith. I'm a 65 years old woman and from Congo. I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two children.    My husband and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened, my business and concern for making money was all I live for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. Only recently I saw on television the colossal loss of properties and livelihood people in Canberra, Australia through fire.    I was moving with great pity and compassion that I decided to make this contribution on assisting people over there, I kept $US25,000,000.00 Million in a long-term deposit account in a Finance company. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophagi cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of the fire outbreak in Australia and other charity organization. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.    Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and  distributes it accordingly. Use your judgment to distribute the money and keep 20% of it to yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money. If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as possible. May the good lord bless you and your family.    Please, send reply and all correspondences to my attorney :  Barrister.

64	DR.DANIEL IBE. FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERAL RESOURCES. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, LAGOS, NIGERIA WEST AFRICA. ATTN: Please reply to:danielibe1616@yahoo.com.au Dear Friend, RE:REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.  I,on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This  fund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my  parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts.  We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank  account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.  We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services.  This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences. I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so,  contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importanceb for security reasons. Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency. N.B: Your telephone and fax numbers are needed for easy communication. Best regards, DR.Daniel Ibe. CIVIL SERVANT FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERAL RESOURCES      
36	Dear friend,  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.  I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have  distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves.   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18,000,000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe.   I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.  God be with you.  mr. JAIN HAGIS  I will not want you to send me an email on this box. I will want you to send me an email on this box {jahagis3@myway.com}. This is because my brother saw me when I was sending this email to you and I will not want them to know that I am in contact with you.                  __________________________________________________________________________________ MailMN-Mongol Tumnii Email.

I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves.   Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18,000,000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe.   I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.  God be with you.  mr. JAIN HAGIS  I will not want you to send me an email on this box. I will want you to send me an email on this box {jahagis3@myway.com}. This is because my brother saw me when I was sending this email to you and I will not want them to know that I am in contact with you.                  __________________________________________________________________________________ MailMN-Mongol Tumnii Email.

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department  of BANK OF AFRICA. I am writing to seek your cooperation over this business deal.  In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of$30million USD(THIRTY  million US dollars)only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took  place in Kenya, East Africa, the Late DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY, a citizen of  Atlanta, United  States of America but naturalised in Burkina Faso, West  Africa and contractor with ECOWAS,(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) . Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind  for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money Remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expenses in cured  during the business and 50 % would be for me. There after I will come over to your  country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to  the deceased, indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted .

58	DEAR BELOVED,    I am Mrs. Christina Holden.   Am married to Dr. Donald Holden. a Liberian who worked for Shell Oil  Company in Nigeria,he died after a brief illness that lasted for only  four days. Before his death we were married for 11 good years without a  child and were both born again Christians . Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible forbids.    When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million  (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank.Presently,  this money is still under the safe keeping of the RESERVE FINANCE  COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next  Three(3) months due to my cancer problems.   Though what disturbs me most now, i recently had stroke.Having known  my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or betterstill a  Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money theway I am  going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my  husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation  where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason  for taking this bold decision.    As soon as I receive your reply I will forward your personal  information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your  telephone and fax number to my lawyer through his email  so that he  will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be  transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.  I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as  the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want  you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my  shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund  when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a  life of a worthy Christian.   Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and  truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me  room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated  herein.Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.    Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.   Yours in Christ,   Mrs. Christina Holden.          Endlich Sicherheit bei Computerabstuerzen - Phoenix Recover Pro. http://internetzugang.tiscali.de/internet_services/detail_rec.php

34	Hello  This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i  decided to contact you through this medium.  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the  U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has  defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.   I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know  that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this  world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties  and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,  England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.  I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation.   I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital.   Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you.   If you can help respond back to me on my private email: razaqin3@yahoo.es  Razaq Samiu

30	From: Lady Peggy Morrison, 4 Old Church Street, Chelsea, SW3, England.  Here writes  Lady Peggy Morrison, suffering from cancerous ailment. I  am married to Engineer Richard Morrison an Englishman who is dead. My  husband was into private practice all his life before his death.  Our life together as man and wife lasted for three decades without  child. My husband died after aprotracted illness. My husband and  I made a vow to uplift the down-trodden andthe less-privileged  individuals as he had passion for persons who can not help  themselves due to physical disability or financial predicament. I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this  relationship,which never came.   When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 20  Million (20Million Great Britain Pounds Sterling which were  derived from his vast estates a nd investment in capital market  with his bank here in UK. Presently, this money is still with the  Bank.  Recently, my Doctor told me that I have limited days to live  due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from.  Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition  to the cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family,  and me I have decided to donate this fund to you and want you to  use this gift which comes from my husbands effortto fund the  upkeep of widows, widowers, orphans, destitute, the down-trodden,physically challenged children, barren-women and persons who prove  to be genuinely handicapped financially.  It is often said that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this  decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this  money and my husband relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy  persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be  misused or invested into ill perceived ventures. I do not want a  situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of  death henceI know where I am going. I know that I am going to be with the Almighty  when Ieventually pass on. The Almighty will  fight my case and I shall hold my peace.  I do not need any  telephone communication in this regard due to my deteriorating  health and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of  the bank in UK. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority that  will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund via my Lawyer. My  happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Please  always be prayerful all t hrough your life. Please assure me that  you will act just as I have stated herein.

E-mail:dr_mikechibuzor02@yahoo.com.hk[ PLEASE REPLY ME WITH THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS]  Attention:ceo   First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction; this is virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.   I am the Executive Investigation Chairman Committee on Review of Contracts Payments instituted by H.E. President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all contracts executed and payments made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha. I have been mandated by my colleagues on the Committee to seek your assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$31.5Million.   As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of his government embezzled billion of dollars through spurious contracts and payments to foreigners between 1993-1998, and this is now the subject of probe by my Committee. In the course of our review, we have discovered the sum of US$31.5Million,which the former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death on June 8, 1998. It is this amount that my colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your assistance. This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot acquire the fund in our names.   We have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free arrangement through which the fund can be transferred within a very short time, if you follow strictly our instructions. The plan is to use our position and influence on the Committee to present you as a foreign contractor beneficiary of the fund. We shall arrange all documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf. The arrangement is perfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the transaction can be concluded within 7-10 working days from when you agree to assist us.   You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through the above Telephone and Fax numbers Or E-Mail address so we can further discuss the modalities of your cooperation and negotiate the charge for your kindly assistance. You were highly recommended and You definitely have a lot to benefit from this transaction as we are prepared to give you 30% of the total funds as soon as you secure it in your Account.   Please, endeavour to give me your telephone/fax number(s)including a bank details  for  the  transfer of the  above  fund,through which we can communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the need for strict confidentiality is of essence to this transaction.  Please i want your reply from this email:<dr_mikechibuzor02@yahoo.com.hk>  We await your urgent response.   Yours Faithfully,   DR.MIKE  CHIBUZOR. CHIARMAN CONTRACT REVEIW.

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner, a person who has a fear of God that cannot betray my remaining family and me as I don't even know whom to trust so I allowed the spirit of God to lead me. I am Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, wife to the late leader of the National Union of the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA) After surviving more than a dozen assassination attempts, my husband, Savimbi was killed four years later, in February 2002, in a battle with Angolan government troops.

35	Dear Friend,   With great pleasure I Mr. Donald Ofu Obidima, Credit control Manager of a Bank (name upheld)is writing you in respect of a foreign customer an Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum corporation,Engr.Lee Seunghyo made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which crashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee Seunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  Since the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the account with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of USD.$25million, [Twenty five million United States Dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for this money asthe heir.  A member of our government trade delegation to your country gave your impeccable profile to me. Hence I have decided to seek your co-operation in this business deal due to the sensitivity of this transaction. It may interest you to know that I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local Bank account here, but can only be approved to a foreigner with an account since the money is in US Dollars. I have decided as a matter of urgency upon this discovery now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the deceased Engr. Lee Seunghyo as No one has ever come forward to claim this fund.  In accordance to Nigerian Law, fund deposited for a long period of time without claim will be reverted to the Nigerian Government treasury if nobody applies to claim this fund after a long period of time. I want you to co-operate with me so that the fruits of this man's labour will not get into the hands of some unsrupulous corrupt government officials if NOT CLAIMED now. I have secured from the probate an Order of Madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Hence I am contacting you with this proposal.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately the following below:  1.full names and address 2.Date of Birth 3.Tel & Fax Numbers  So that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two Attorneys for drafting and notorization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.  The Bank cannot release the fund from his account unlesssomeone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. I have almost resolved to finalize this transaction with some money to secure documents in your name as the bonafide beneficiary of this fund $25m which guarantees our safety and successful transfer. With the above suggestion, It is reliable,safe and quick for transfer process.  At the successful conclusion of this business, your goodself shall be entitled to have 40% that is, USD$10m of the total money while I will have 55% that is USD$13.750m and 5% that is USD$1.250m for communications and other expenses. I am ready to invest a reasonable percentage of mine into any viable business you suggest as a joint partner.  Your response is highly imperative as this is a TWO-man business deal transaction as I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I need your assistance and co-operation to this reality as I have done my Home-work and fine tune the best way to create you as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction with you as the beneficiary to this fund. Your percentage will also be a source of upliftment.You have absolutely nothing to LOSE in assisting me instead, you have so much to GAIN. Be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us.  I will appreciate your early reply for commencement of business.Contact me for acknowledgement by E-mail and whereby you are not interested, please indicate in your reply so that I can seek for the assistance of someone else.  Thanks for your expected co-operation and treat ASAP as your utmost Trust,Honesty and Confidentiality will be highly appreciated in this business deal transaction.  Thanks with great regards.  Mr. Donald Ofu Obidima   
40	Dear Beloved in Christ,   Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it  as I know we don't know each. It's my belief that I am doing the lord's  bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the  courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I  will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and  unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I  trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in  my heart.     It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I  had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for  eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and  glory upon my life.     I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an  expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before  he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My  Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before  his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I  decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the  sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in  a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently,  this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management  just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has  become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the  completion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not  re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a  letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my  condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come  over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I  will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing  treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my  doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last  wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the  World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth  here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an  orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.   Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my  illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this  responsibility to any one of them any more.      I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or  you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open  your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why  would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and  be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA  except, that I know that the lord's way are not our ways. I have come to  conclude that's it's divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by  his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty  of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become  very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you  are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It's all part of the big  picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend  forever............     Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary  and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who  will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the  word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible  made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this  decision because I don�t have any child that will inherit this money and my  husbands� relatives are not Christians and I don�t want my husbands� hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don�t want a situation where  this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking  this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going  to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14}  says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not  communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice  and presence of my husbands� relatives around me always. I don�t want them  to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my  husband's wealth and not my health.     With God all things are possible.    Your Sister in Christ, Mrs. Sandra White.

55	 Good day   I know this mail might come to you as surprise but kindly allow me the  opportunity of introducing myself. I am Ms. Aminata Bobi Kabila;  daughter of  the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasa  (former  Zaire), Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila.  I got your particulars through the South African Chamber of Commerce;  However, i am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on  this  confidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both my  family and you.   Before i go into further details, please be informed that i am writing  without any other perso(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this  transaction. Therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained  all through. I have the sum of USD8.5 Million from a secret sale of  Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body  guards  (Rashid) on January 16th 2001. The essence of this mail is to ask you  to stand as my foreign partner and receive the fund on my behalf as i  can not do much on my own due to security reasons, my narration below  will explain better. Before i continue, be well informed that your  share  in this transaction has been calculated at 30% of the total sum, 5% for  expenses that may be incurred if any and the rest for my family and me.   My father as an African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having  married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my  father, my step-brother Joseph, who is the current president of my  country,  is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about  this deal.   Already president Joseph is using his power to colonise all the money  and private property which our father left behind for the whole family.  Now my mother, myself and my younger brother are left with nothing in  the inheritance of my late father’s wealth. Our situation is seriously  critical that we need your assistance to help us receive this fund for  relocation overseas and for proper investment jointly between we and  you. Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction  because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that  shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present  the  money is in cash and is secured in a security company as family  treasures. I am waiting for your quick and favourable response, and in case you  have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me urgently.   Thanks,   Ms. Aminata B. Kabila.

Depuis que nous  avions obtenus les informations sur  sa mort, nous nous  attendions à ce que ses proches parents ou sa proche relation viennent  réclamer l�argent. Malheureusement jusqu�aujourd�hui aucune manifestation.  Dans ses cas figurent,en conformité avec les lois et reglements interieurs  des operations bancaires de la boite,stipulent que,si une telle somme  restait,sans aucune manifestation quelconque d'un proche,six années  après,ladite somme est transferée dans le tresor de la banque,comme etant un  fond non reclamé.  Suite à cette découverte j'ai décidé de vous faire  cette proposition  d'affaire, afin de pouvoir libérer l'argent.Dautant Puisque personne ne  vient la réclamer , je propose que vous vous déclarer  à la banque comme  etant un parent ou une proche relation de la famille defunte. Si nous tombons d�accord,45% de la somme sera à vous,les 5% servirons aux  frais occasionnant les operations du transfert,et les 50% serons à moi.  Par conséquent, pour permettre le  transfert immédiat de ces fonds,il vous  faut ouvrir à votre nom, un compte bancaire si vous n'a n'aviez pas,ensiute  vous devez adresser une lettre à la banque comme etan un proche parent de la  famille défunte comme suit:  - le nom de votre banque, - votre numéro de compte bancaire, - votre numéro de fax et de téléphone privé  NB: Pour le numero de compte meme si votre compte est vide ce ne pas grave  pourvu que ça soit un compte  activé   À la réception de votre réponse, je vous enverrai  par fax ou par émail le  formulaire de la lettre d'application que vous allez remplir et envoyer à  l'adresse de la banque.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such  money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into  the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this  transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,I agree that 30% of  this money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the provision  of a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me ,  After which I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the  percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as I have arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving  account details where the money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy  communication.

64	    >From . Mr. Simon Robson. Date: 27 - 1 - 2007.  Kindest Attention:  My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use it to help those in Need.  N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.  I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.  God be with you.  Mr. Simon Robson.

55	   From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.  Good Day ,  I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United State Dollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that our client Col.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United State Dollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan so thatyou will be able to receive his funds.  MODALITIES:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col. Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of probate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.  Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you be interested please send me your,  1,Full names, 2,Private phone number, 3,Current residential address.

Hosam Hassan who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Thirty Million United State Dollars($30,000,000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that our client Col.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Thirty Million United State Dollars($30,000,000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop,my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Col.Hosam Hassan so thatyou will be able to receive his funds.  MODALITIES:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col. Hosam Hassan,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of probate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.  Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you.Should you be interested please send me your,  1,Full names, 2,Private phone number, 3,Current residential address.  And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;  (pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)  and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  Kind Regards, Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan.

65	Goodday to you,        My name is Victoria McKnight and I am an artist. I live in London,England with my two kids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about 23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college art courses.Most of my work is done in either pencil or air brush mixed with color pencils. I have recently added designing and creating art work on the computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work featured on trading cards,prints and in magazines. I have sold ingalleries and to private collectors from all  around the world.I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to International Clients,they are always offering to pay with an International POSTAL MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash here in ENGLAND.      I am looking for a representative outside the United Kingdom who will be working for me as a partime worker and i will be willing to pay 10% for every transaction to you,which wouldnt affect your present state of work, i need someone who would  help me recieve payments from my customers outside the united kingdom.i mean someone that is responsible and reliable,because the cost of coming to the state and recieving  payments is very expensive for me and it is also time consuming for me because i am always busy with work,i am working on setting up a branch outside the United Kingdom,so for now i need a representative who will be  handling the payment aspect.     These payments are in money order and they would come to you in your name, so all you need do is cash the money orders and deduct your percentage and wire the rest back. But the problem i have is trust,It wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments which will be sent to you by fedex or usps from my business patners, which would come in form of a money order then you are to cash it and send the cash to me via western union money transfer or moneygram money transfer,all transfer fees should be deducted from the money. Regards Victoria McKnight Inc. 100 Gellatly Way, London SE1 34D England. Fax:+447031845365 vmcknight_arts80@yahoo.com

Depuis que nous  avions obtenus les informations sur  sa mort, nous nous  attendions à ce que ses proches parents ou sa proche relation viennent  réclamer l�argent. Malheureusement jusqu�aujourd�hui aucune manifestation.  Dans ses cas figurent,en conformité avec les lois et reglements interieurs  des operations bancaires de la boite,stipulent que,si une telle somme  restait,sans aucune manifestation quelconque d'un proche,six années  après,ladite somme est transferée dans le tresor de la banque,comme etant un  fond non reclamé.  Suite à cette découverte j'ai décidé de vous faire  cette proposition  d'affaire, afin de pouvoir libérer l'argent.Dautant Puisque personne ne  vient la réclamer , je propose que vous vous déclarer  à la banque comme  etant un parent ou une proche relation de la famille defunte. Si nous tombons d�accord,45% de la somme sera à vous,les 5% servirons aux  frais occasionnant les operations du transfert,et les 50% serons à moi.  Par conséquent, pour permettre le  transfert immédiat de ces fonds,il vous  faut ouvrir à votre nom, un compte bancaire si vous n'a n'aviez pas,ensiute  vous devez adresser une lettre à la banque comme etan un proche parent de la  famille défunte comme suit:  - le nom de votre banque, - votre numéro de compte bancaire, - votre numéro de fax et de téléphone privé  NB: Pour le numero de compte meme si votre compte est vide ce ne pas grave  pourvu que ça soit un compte  activé   À la réception de votre réponse, je vous enverrai  par fax ou par émail le  formulaire de la lettre d'application que vous allez remplir et envoyer à  l'adresse de la banque. Je porte à  votre connaissance que  cette transaction ne comporte aucun  risque car toutes les dispositions seront prises,dautant puisque moi-meme je  suis un membre influent de la banque.

Si j'ai un conseil à vous donner,c'est d'etre tres discret,car seule dans la  discretion que nous pourrions reussir. Vous voyez ces sommes n'ont jamais eté utilisées comme il se doit.Les  premiers responsables les acheminent à d'autres fins.

32	Hello.         My Name is John Koenig, A native of Britain, I   have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It has   defied all forms of medical treatment, and right now I   have only about a few months to live, according to   medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life   so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even   myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was   never generous, I was always hostile to people and only   focused on my business as that was the only thing I   cared for. But now I regret all this, as I now know that   there is more to life than just wanting to have or make   all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me   a second chance to come to this world I would live my   life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that   God has called me, I have willed and given most of my   property and assets to my immediate and extended family   members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be   merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to   give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be   one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have   distributed money to some charity organizations in the   U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.     Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot   do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my   family to close one of my accounts and distribute the   money, which I have there to charity organization in   Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money   to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as   they seem not to be contended with what I have left for   them. The last of my money, which no one knows of, is   the huge cash deposit of eighteen million three hundred   thousand dollars ($18, 300, 000, 00) that I have with a   finance House abroad. I will want you to help the world   collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity   organizations.   N/B: Kindly note that 60% of this fund must go to the   tsunami and hurricane victims and 40% for your effort   and time. Please live right!!   Thanks.   Mr.John Koenig.      
36	Dearest Friend, Compliments of the day, before I proceed, I must be grateful to introduce myself. I am Mr. Eddy G. Ibe, the son of the late Gen.

I would therefore like you to help me in every possible way in securing this funds in your country. Furthermore I will like you to assist me in finding a good business that I will invest this fund.

Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the fund belongs to me and the rest of my family now, of which i am the sole benefficiary and trustee on behalf of my younger ones who are currently on assylum some where. As soon as I get your consent, I will contact my lawyer to start making arrangement on how to change the ownership of the consignment into your name, for easy transfer of the money out of here, since you will be my trustee to the transaction and thereafter transfer to your country's foreign account and i will finally come over to your country for all the final arrangements. I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter.

69	Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.

66	RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear Sir,         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia. Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia. It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question. This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government. And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003. Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money. So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type. I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture. Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.  Best regards,  Mrs.Atiya Mohameed      
68	My Dear,  I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign  remittance department Bank Of Africa.  In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million  five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane  crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.  I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision  of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.  Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your  bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number  for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting  to hear from you immediately.  Yours faithfully.  Mrs Aicha Ahmed.  N/B: CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL OR EMAIL Me.

32	    >From . Mr. Simon Robson. Date: 10 - 2 - 2007.  Kindest Attention:  My name is Mr. Simon Robson. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use it to help those in Need.  N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.  I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.  God be with you.  Mr. Simon Robson.

54	St.Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Road London SE1 7EH United-Kingdom. Tel: 447035900075.                      Dear Friend In Christ,   I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life.   My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed.   My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster.   My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you.   Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me.   I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing.   As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly.   I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today.   Please reply this mail immediately if you have the love and care of God at: help.ed_brown@yahoo.co.uk   Thank you.   Mr. Edward Brown +447045700928.

33	  Good Day,     My name is Mr. Micheal Tan. I trained and work as an external auditor for the United Oversea Bank (UOB) Malaysia.  I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor , who bears the same last name  with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years.   Banking regulation legislation in malaysia  demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies.   The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Malaysia .    This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you.    Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk . Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.   I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and co-operation to my proposal please do so by email, stating your full names, date of birth, telephone number and fax number and occupation. I do expect your prompt response.      Thank you  Mr. Micheal Tan Email: micheal_tan@infohq.com

60	FROM THE DESK OF MR  JAVED AHMED. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A). OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA.  Dear Friend,  I am the manager of bill and exchange department  BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) In  my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15m US dollars ( fifteen  million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane  crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash  leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release  the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want  this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of  this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision  of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the  business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.  Then after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement  accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate  trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank  as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your  bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and  effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted .  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application.  I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me  immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you  immediately.  PLEASE MY DEAR  FRIEND THIS IS MY PRIVATE LINE YOU CAN  CALL    ME IMMIDEATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL.  00226 (76  63  87 21)  THANKS MR JAVED AHMED.

On the 2nd of August 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Gatwick Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client’s extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you.   I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my client before they got confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Finance House where the deceased had an account valued at about US$20.7M has issued me a notice to provide the next-of-kin or have the account confiscated within the next Forteen official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over nine (9) months now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$20.7M can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money 60% to me and 35% to you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may required.   I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make, all I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.   Await your prompt response in my private email address <jkvan@mail.com>  for better communication.   Yours Sincerely,   Jack Vanrenos Esq.  -- Jack Vanrenos Esq. jkvan@mail.com    ------------------------------------------------------  **This mail was sent by SaigonNet WebMail 1.0  ------------------------------------------------------    
62	   Mr. Huang Yanxiong Hang Seng Bank Ltd. 83 Des Voeux Rd. Branch, Central Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Tel/Fax: +852-301-77033   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Huang Yanxiong credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General.Ibrahim Umar who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Umar did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of Kin to Gen. Ibrahim Umar so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Umar, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred, we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you.Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication, you can and I will provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated.  Kind Regards  Mr. Huang Yanxiong

41	FROM: MR. Jackson Khumalo JOHANNESBURG-SOUTH AFRICA Private email: jackkhumalo@sify.com         ATTN: PRESIDENT/ CEO,   DIRECTOR, DELIVERY/OPERATIONS RE: TRANSFER OF US$25 MILLION FOR INVESTMENT.  I am Mr. Jackson khumalo, the Director of Delivery/Operations in a security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa especially top government officials and military leaders in the world. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on  Business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. To be explicit and straight to the point, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's  Vault for safekeeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his  Consignment had accumulated I discovered that our client was the former Late Prime  Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri,                       PROFILE of the Late Minister of Lebanon: Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri {November 1, 1944 � February 14, 2005} married to Nazek Audi  Hariri, was a Lebanese self � made billionaire and business tycoon, and was former  Prime Minister of Lebanon {1992 � 1998 and 2000 � 2004} before his late resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to  {http://www.hariri.info}.  After in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or  Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box that were registered as treasures by our client actually  contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this money in our care. After going through his (WILL) I  Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).  Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I  Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment. This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail  (jackkhumalo@sify.com)  I await your most prompt response.

43	  FROM THE DESK OF RAJI RAJI BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.  Dear Friend,  How are you,first i will explain my self little to youbefore we continue. I  am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department ofAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  (ADB)I am writing to seekyour interest over a transaction.  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of$15m US dollars (FIFTEEN  MILLIONS US DOLLARS) . In anaccount that belongs to one of our foreign  customer who died along with his entire family in November 2002  in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one orther official in my  department have decided to make this business proposal to you and release  the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want  this money to go into the Bank's treasury as unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank's  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannotstand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50 % would be for me and my colleague. There after I will visit  your country for disbursement of the fund according to the percentages  indicated in this proposal. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of  this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations  or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will beremitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the  application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch free and that you  should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.   Trusting to hear from you immediately.   Your�s faithfully RAJI RAJI Bill and Exchange Manager, Africa Development Bank (A.D.B)  _________________________________________________________________ Gagnez des écrans plats avec Live.com http://www.image-addict.fr/

35	This item from National Association of the Deaf   has been forwarded to you by Mrs Suha Arafat.    Dear Friend,  I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b  roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3479937.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3995769.stm  It is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my lawyer who is base in London Uk to finalize this transaction with you.

62	MANAGING DIRECTOR DAH SING BANK LTD 36TH FLOOR DAH SING BANK FINANCIAL CENTRE LTD. 108 GLOUCESTER ROAD, HONG KONG Phone/Fax: +852-3010-7073   Dear Friend,   I am Mr. Hon-Hing Wong , Managing Director Dah Sing Bank Ltd, Hong Kong.   I am contacting you with respect to a portfolio amounting to $35,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollar) deposited by a German Merchant named Mr. Mathew Schneider.   On the 18th of October 2002  Mr. Mathew Schneider  deposited $12,000,000 USD (Twelve Million United States Dollars) under our portfolio management department for four years and the deposit matured on the 18th of October 2006 with over 196% growth which amounted to a total of $35,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollar).   Mr. Mathew Schneider, has since passed away without stating his next of kin because he deposited the funds in our establishment at a point he was finalizing divorcing his wife and had no kids coupled with the fact that he was an orphan, this funds has since mature and the roll-over on the funds has also expired.   This sum of $35,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollar) is still  in my possession in my Bank lifeless and unnoticed because there will never be a claim on the funds and all material and immaterial documents and certificates relating to the funds is also in my possession.   According to the Hong Kong Law regulating cases of this nature which is also typical to other Asian countries, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, such funds will revert to the ownership of the Government for financing military operations, such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military.   In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Mathew Schneider so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in general.   The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you and the balance of 5% for  will be responsible for the major /trivial expenses incurred in the course of the transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this project will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you are interested, please reply immediately.   Upon your response, I shall then provide you with further information's and modalities that will help you understand the transaction.   You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Mr. Hon-Hing Wong

60	Dear friend,   I apollogize in advance if this mail comes as an embarrassment because of so many things that happens in our times. I am Isaac Baka, the site inspection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked directly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of Sudan.     I awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few years ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreement to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million.   As a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce this funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here in my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and as this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund out for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under diplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure.  I therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund into your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually beneficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smooth movement of this funds until you are in control of it.    Please let me know if you are interested by return mail to be sent to: (isbaka@myway.com, isbaka@sify.com). Also include your full names and contact telephone number to enable me call you.

67	Good Day,   I am Mr. Chen Jiang, Bank Manager of a Bank in China.I have an urgent  and very confidential business proposition for you.On November 6, 2001,  a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals  Corporation, Made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States  Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to  his forwarding address but got no reply.   After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that he died  from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that  he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of  kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and  discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Depos! it paperwork  in my Bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank  and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year.   No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws ofRepublic  of China, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to  the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner  to stand in as the next of kin to the man so that the fruits of this  old man's  labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government  officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your  full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.   shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and authorization  of the WILL and to obtain the necessary doc! uments and letter of  probate/administration in your favor!  for the transfer.A bank account in  any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the  transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money  will be paid into your  account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 50% for you.   There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are  interested, please reply immediately via the private email address  chenjiang022@yahoo.com.hkUpon your response, I shall then provide you  with more details and  relevantdocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please  send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy  communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require you! r assistance to invest my share in your country.   Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.  chenjiang022@yahoo.com.hk  Thanks and regards.  Chen Jiang.          
42	   Dear sir/Madam,  I have the honour and confidence to introduce this business to you in view of the fact that you are trustworthy and reliable as my inquires reveals.  I am Mr. Andrew Clark I work in the Foreign Payment Department of the National WestMinster Bank here in London Uk. There is an account opened in this bank in 1994 but since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again. After a private and intensive investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account (Mr. Chapman Mark J.) was an oil merchant - a foreigner, who died since 1998 without having a beneficiary to this account.  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  My investigation proved to me he never informed any of his family members about this funds and he also did not have any next of kin to the said funds. The amount in this account is  Fifty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pound sterling. Since no one has come forth to claim these funds, the bank management is willing to welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this Account which I will give upon receipt of your positive response towards my proposal. I assure you a 100% that there is no risk to this business. After its conclusion I will retrieve all documents used in the transfer and destroy them in your presence, when I come over to your account base for sharin of funds and possible investment.  Sharing will be 30% for you, 0.5% for any expenses incurred during this business 30% for charity organizations because this was one of the things he made known to me personaly before he died in the plane crash while the remaining 35% for me. As soon as I hear from you I will put up an annual leave so I could be able to facilitate the transfer of this fund to any Account of your choice.  Contact me urgently for the way forward.  Thanks.  Andrew Clark.

40	Hallo friend,  This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before   neither in person nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes   just one day to meet or know someone either physically or through   correspondence. I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as   being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt   in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr.   Liu Yan a transfer supervisor operations in investment section in Bank   of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK Charitable Foundation 13/F.   Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong Kong I have an obscured   business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client   General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also   business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,   with a value of Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United States   Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war.   Again after the war another notification was sent and still no   response came from him. We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim   Ali and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that   hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that   General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not declare any next of kin in his   official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he   also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one   except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five   Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and   no one will ever come forward to claim it.  What bothers me most is that, according to the to the laws of my   country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the   ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the   funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like   you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed   Jassim Ali so that you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to   know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out   successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the   necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to General   Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at this stage is   for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number and   Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been   made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on   your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in   your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be   provided by you with my guidiance.There is no risk involved at all in   the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney   will prepare all the necessary documents.  Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning   this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated   bank account we shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If   you are interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax   and current residential address, and I will prefer you to reach me on   my private and secure email address below (liuyan_1968@yahoo.com.hk)   and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this   operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. N:B Please make sure you contact me on my private email   (liuyan_1968@yahoo.com.hk)  Kind Regards  Liu Yan   
44	  Hello,   My name is Mrs Maryam Ibrahim,owner of MARYAM   IBRAHIM TEXTILES TRADING, TAILORING & EMBROIDERY  Po Box 34285 Dubai,United Arab Emirates.Am 58years old,  suffering from long time cancer of the breast.  From all indications my condition is really  deteriorating and it's quite obvious that I won't  live more than 2 months according to my doctors.  This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a  very bad stage.     My late husband died early last year from  heart attack, and during the period of our marriage  we couldn't produce any child. My late husband was  very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business   and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I  will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now  decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly  to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia  and Europe.   Before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon,  in dubai and deposited the sum of 20 million dollars  (Twenty million dollars) in a security company in europe some  years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds   and distribute it yourself to charity.  so that when i die my soul can rest in peace.  the funds will be entirely in hands and management.

44	DEAR FRIEND,  I am Mr.Joseph Poon Executive Director Of Operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch,171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong.  An Iraqi named Hamadi Hashem a business man made a numbered fixed deposit of (346,736,899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months; this is valued to Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war,four years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Hamadi Hashem and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.  After furtherinvestigation it was also discovered that Hamadi Hashem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration five years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if no body applies to claim the funds.  My proposal, I am prepared to place you as the next of kin in a position to instruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds FIFTY - FIFTY. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days.I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to Hamadi Hashem I will then officially communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these:all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.  Should you be interested please send me your full names,Phone Number and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below.E-mail: josephpoon_enquiries@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  I await your response. Mr.JOSEPH POON.

59	FROM THE DESK OF:MR . RAHA. ALI dIRECTOR AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT, BANK OF AFRICA, OUAGA-BURKINA-FASO.  ATTN: Please.  Greetings to you, I am Mr.Raha.Ali. the Account Manager of Late Mr.Morris  Thompson in Bank of Africa, here in Burkina Faso.However I got your contact  through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email  because I feel that it is more secured and private.  Recently i discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued  USD14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our  late Customer who died in a plane crash.  During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr. Morris Thompson an  American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately  lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my  investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ andttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of  the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our  discovery of this development.  The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six  years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is  only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.  In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted  colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to  Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your  account as the beneficiary´s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris  Thompson.  In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in  this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the  time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward  claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account  or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty  a/c can also serve for this purpose.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as  gratification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me.  What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have  in my possession, all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish  this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.  Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive  response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your interest to enable us proceed. I await your Urgent Response  Regrads, MR .RAHA.

36	 STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   Sir                             PARTNERSHIP IN BUSINESS      After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward to you this proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of US$40.5M (forty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only into his account.      This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by us under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed. Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the contract. We are now left with the balance of US$40.5M as the over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use.      But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate or own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. We have agreed that you will be entitled for 30% of the total sum, 60% for us while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.  As you may rightly want to know I got your address from our Chambers of Commerce and Industry. I am a top official with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR). We the officials involved in the deal have put in many years of services to our ministries. We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a lifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This transaction is very much free from all sorts of risks.       To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present an international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, we will fax to you the information you will transcribe into your invoice and send back to us. As soon as the funds are remitted into your nominated account, three officials will visit you to arrange for our share. All these will only take us 10 working days to transfer this fund into your account right from the day we receive the requirements.       NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited, because we are still in Government service. Let honesty and trust be our watchwords throughout this transaction. And your Prompt reply will be highly appreciated.      Best regards.

46	FROM THE DESK OF Mr,KAREM AHMED. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA. PHONE CONTACT  00226.78.89.77.34   DEAR FRIEND,  I know you may be surprise to recieve this e-mail ; I got your contact  address from the internet while I was searching for my friend that has  similar name with you. I am the manager of bill and exchange BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) at foreign  remittance department. There is a business I would want you to champion for me, in my department I  discovered an abandoned sum of ($31.500.000 U.S) thirty one million five  hundred thousands US dollars)  In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along  with his entire family on 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight  AF4590] with the whole passenger�s aboard. The name of the deceased man was  (MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany) N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly, visit the web site to enable  you know whether we can work together, below is the website.                      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  You have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I  was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank  management for the annual audit of the year. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as  unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot  stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any   foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the  time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason  why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the  next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will  need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after  due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank  where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank  account.  I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I  agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect  to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will  visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you  must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in  the money will be remitted.  All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once  started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full  support. This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any  precaution there after. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter reply to thi box. at;  Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully, Mr,KAREM AHMED Bill and exchange manager, BANK OF AFRICA  _________________________________________________________________ Personnalisez votre Messenger avec Live.com  http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/

Hello, I have gone through your profile which informed my contemplation to enquire in confidence,if we can jointly do some genuine and legal stock transfer trading together based on a Joint Venture. I have an operative international certified acceptable Medium Term Note Stock (Program) le, which I was thinking we could work with you to reassign the account to your name, and I assume you must have powerful financial sense and capability. After the reassignment, the amount would be transferred to your bank account. The principal amount of the POF is US$50 Million, and I have already worked out modalities to execute the transfer successfully; hence I ask of you to confirm ASAP whether or not you are interested. The BOE is an irrevocable Bank Operative Instrument, which you can use as collateral to bank against a loan immediately we fully reassign to you, which means your bank can even borrow against it. I shall send you evidence of funds which once can still through bank-to-bank confirm existence. I would appreciate that you get back to me upon receipt of this important mail on your opinion towards a lasting business relationship.  Respectfully, Williams Morrow

38	FROM THE DESK OF Mr,KAREM AHMED. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA. PHONE CONTACT  00226.78.89.77.34   DEAR FRIEND,  I know you may be surprise to recieve this e-mail ; I got your contact  address from the internet while I was searching for my friend that has  similar name with you. I am the manager of bill and exchange BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) at foreign  remittance department. There is a business I would want you to champion for me, in my department I  discovered an abandoned sum of ($31.500.000 U.S) thirty one million five  hundred thousands US dollars)  In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along  with his entire family on 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight  AF4590] with the whole passenger�s aboard. The name of the deceased man was  (MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany) N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly, visit the web site to enable  you know whether we can work together, below is the website.                      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  You have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I  was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank  management for the annual audit of the year. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as  unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot  stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any   foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the  time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason  why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the  next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will  need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after  due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank  where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank  account.  I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I  agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect  to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will  visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you  must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in  the money will be remitted.  All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once  started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full  support. This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any  precaution there after. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter reply to thi box. at;  Trusting to hear from you immediately.

58	One with Christ,  It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,knowing the truth and the truth have set me free.Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God?s mercy and glory upon my life. I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you, having seen your contact from the Internet. I am Barrister Martinez Obe, the legal adviser to late Mr.and Mrs.Grieves Martins a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 25 years before they died in the Bellview plane crash . They are good Christian, They so dedicated to God but They had no child till they died.  Throughout their stay in my country, They acquired a lot of properties like lands, house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, They instructed me to write their WILL. Because they had no child, They dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God, Orphanages and less privilegdes ones. As Their legal adviser, all the documents for the properties were in my care. They gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God.  In short, I sold all the properties after their death, as they instructed And as matter of fact, after I sold all their properties, I realized more than $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars plus),and what supposed to be the percentage interest of my right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties, this was base on the initial agreement between me and the owner of the properties before their death.  Therefore the total amount left to be invested into God's work as instructed by the owner, is $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars) only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to me by the owner before their death.  I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the consignments with a security company. I did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments; therefore I registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what I deposited with them was Gold Bars.  I had encounter with Christ when Rev. Billy Graham was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: "When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and committee iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before her death.  I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before her death. After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to a honest Christian but after my fervent prayer over it, then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God, so these are how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact information, and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God.  I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad and the security company has since been waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my country and move to abroad. You should also forward to me your telephone and fax number for easy communication and to fax you the documents concerning the consignments.  prompt response will be highly appreciated.you can contact me on my secured e-mail address martinezobe84@keromail.com  Yours in Christ Barrister Martinez Obe.

44	  Good Day I am Mr. Patrick Chan, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business suggestion for you.  Our client Gen. Samir Abi Rahman who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Several maturities notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him.

Samir Abi Rahman did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

58	My Dear,   With all sincerity and humility it is with deep pains i write you this message of wishful assistance to my predicament. I am Mrs Jewel Taylor the estranged wife to the former president of Liberia who was asked by unanimous decision by the international community to step down from the corridors of power .  I write you this mail under duress and as a result of my recent decision to better the lives of i and my children.

Currently now i have decided to make do with the sum of $20m (Twenty Million United States Dollars)belonging to my husband in which i am a benefiaciary to, i have decided to relocate with your assistance to your private account the said sum.  My decision was reached when i could not conceive the thought that after the United States Government has promised to let my husband go free based on the condition that he should step down Mr. Collin Powell stated in a press briefing that he would be indicted by the court in Netherlands to face charges on war crimes, this is what led to my decision as God Knows that i was never in support of his involvement in the indecent maltreating of innocent people in Politics.  This decision is hard for me to make but i just have to make it for the sake of my children's future.  Currently the said sum was lodged in a safety deposit box in a financial Institution which i will disclose to you as a matter of commitment to me and this plea for assistance. I currently have the deposit certificate and can draw up a change of beneficiary mandate to effect you as the beneficiary to the funds. I am a trained economist by profession and it is in this line that i will want you to take note that your services for assisting me will be compensated to the best of my ability.  I have this to look forward to so i would like you to keep this project close to your heart just as myself pending when we reach the conclusive end of this project. I will want you as a matter of confidentiality to respond through this mail and also include your telephone number as well so that i can give you a call if the need arises as we are currently on political asylum now in west africa. Once  i get your confirmation that you can be of assistance i will bring you into a clearer picture of the situation at hand.

38	From: Mr. Maekal Mekha. 17 Copse Hill,Baghdad Iraq   My Dear Beloved,       Let me start by introducing myself. I am  Mr. Maekal Mekha, a Baghdad Citizen, Iraq, a Mechant as an occupation. I have a obscured business suggestion for you. I am a brother to Dr.Gerald Mekha,who worked with  Iraq Judicial Commission , Iraq, for over a decade before he died on 20th of March in the year 2007.  He died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. When my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 Million Pounds (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds) with one United Kingdom Security Company in London.  This funds are still with the Security Company for the past 6 years now,the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes, deposited with these company, i am in a refugee camp here in Iraq, as a result of the war in  Iraq this moment, am sorry am not too fine based on my health,though what disturbs me most is my stroke.   Having known my condition and want to make sure i do my father's will, I have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company,that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.   I want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp, still don't know when i'll be granted the visa permit out of Iraq. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in Iraq. Also because of the presence of social security in the camp, I do not want them to know. With Allah all things are possible.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the Security Company in London,United Kingdom. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me.  My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty Allah must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein.   Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and may the Almighty Allah bless you. Kindly send your email message to my mailbox :  mekha_llcs@yahoo.dk  , so i can contact you with more information   Yours sincerely, Mr. Maekal Mekha

42	CAN I TRUST YOU FOR THIS TRANSACTION?  Attn: The President/MD.  Sir,  My name is Mr. James Smith. I trained and work as an external auditor for Abbey national bank - London, working as part of a bigger team that covers  the entire Uk region. I had taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavors.  On routine audit check last month, I discovered some US$ investment accounts that had been dormant for the least twelve years. All the accounts belong to a single holder with monies totaling a little above $25.5 million United States Dollars plus interest.  Banking regulation/legislation in the Uk demands that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies.  The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposals.  My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1994 and the exact time the account was last operated. I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died and no next of kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years.  I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the  funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Great Britain,this is very possible. I want your participation and co-operation.  I have seized all relevant documents  (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with are prepared to allocate a 20% slice of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses.  I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.  Be assured that my colleagues and I are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk whatsoever if you agree to come on board.  Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details.  To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email smith533@sify.com or jamessmith1952@yahoo.co.uk stating your full name, date of birth, direct mobile telephone number, fax number and email address.  I do expect you prompt response.  Thank you,  Mr. James Smith.  Note: Please send your response only through my direct email address:smith533@sify.com or jamessmith1952@yahoo.co.uk   
39	Beloved in christ,      Here writes Mrs Mary Parker, suffering from esophageal cancer. I am married to Mr. Robert Parker an Englishman who is dead. My late husband died with a deposit of £ 17.5 Million Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds) with his bank here in UK derived from his vast estates and investment in capital market . Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians.   Recently, my Doctor told me that I have limited days to live due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from. Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. Recently, the Bank management just wrote me as the beneficiary that our account has been DORMANT and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf as I can not come over. And doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. So it is my last wish to have a God-fearing person use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy persons. And I do not want my husband hard earned money to be used in an unGodly manner by unbelievers in God. You can contact me through my personal email address: maryparker_0022@yahoo.co.uk  Your Sister in Christ, Mrs. Mary Parker.

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this  letter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr.  Mohammed Williams from Angola.The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza  Williams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa.  I got your address from my random search at the net. And, I on behalf of my  widowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams  decided to solicit for your assistance  to transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private  security company in Johannesburg, South Africa.  In fact, my father said, and I quote: �My son, I wish to draw your attention  to US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in  Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very  committed and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found  out that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy  helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to  foreign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and  I were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in  South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and  share it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million  Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).  In case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit  for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to  transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited  the box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your  mother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your  sisters.  >From these words of my late father, you can understand that life and future  of my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can  assist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers.  Financial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit  us certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in  South Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out  of South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared  to offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses incurred during this transaction.  Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I  demand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally  gets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust  confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful  if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm your  interest through the above contact telephone numbers or email.  Best regards,  MOHAMMED WILLIAMS. {For the family}  All responses should be sent to: mohammed_william4@yahoo.com  _________________________________________________________________ Could you be the guest MSN Movies presenter?

I am writing you this letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerful and distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years.. I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK inside the philippines.  In 2001, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds, ten million two hundred thousand dollars(usd10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection. Due to his untimely death in early 2002, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it. This is where you come in.I located you through an agency that helps seek people by their email.my client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds.  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to my client.All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.The allocation of our money will be as follows: 20%(US$2.02M) to you for your part in this, 75% for me and my partners and 5% for any unforeseeable expenses we may incur. I think this is extremely fair, as you have nothing to lose but just a little time, while on the other hand I am staking my flawless reputation among other things. And besides $2.02 million is no pocket change. Once you are approved, the entire transaction should take no longer than twelve business days after which we will go about our daily business, but just millions of dollars richer.  As you can see this is easier than taking candy from a baby but mind you, trust is something that is developed over time and that is something that we do not have.

So please, there should be no room for greed because ten million two hundred thousand dollars can quench even the most insatiable desire for the almighty dollar. Again, i will be in charge of everything else. I will assume all responsibilities for this endeavor so you don’t have to worry about any legal ramifications, just what you will do with all that money. If interested,I would want you to send your reply to my private mail box: (m_socorro27@excite.com) Your urgent response is highly anticipated so please email me for more details on this transaction as soon as possible. This should be kept very secret and confidential… I believe you know. kind Regards Mrs. MRS MARIA SOCORRO esq (m_socorro27@excite.com)

37	FROM THE DESK OF DR.ADAMU  ISMALER AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO. BANK WEBSITE:www.bkofafrica.net  Dear Friend,  I am the manager of auditing and accounting department of BANK OF AFRICA  (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an  abandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US  dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR.  RICHARD BURSON from Florida, U.S.A) who died along with his entire family on  November 1999 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash you can  visit this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/502503.stm  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this  discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that  the money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the  deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for  it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed  dormant fund.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin  in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a  foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a  foreigner.  I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the  provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred  during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your  country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to  enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply  first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a  text of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the  text of application form,I will like you to send me the following  informatios  1.NAME IN FULL:................................ 2.ADDRESS:....................................... 3.NATIONALITY:................................... 4.AGE:............................................. 5.Sex.............................................. 6.OCCUPATION:...................................... 7.MARITAL STATUS:.................................. 8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................ 9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................  so i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective  communication. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application form.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should  contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter,if only you are  intrested and ready to help.  Trusting to hear from you immediately.

58	Dearerst,  I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION  EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL  INFORMATION.I am DR.AME BENJAMIN,the manager of bill and exchange at the  foreign remittance department  Bank of africa burkinafaso.  In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M, (Eight Million,  Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife  and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261  which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on  visiting this website:  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  The Owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska.It is therefore upon this discovery  that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to  release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will be send to you as the next  of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this  money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the  banktreasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three  years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that  will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.  This request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned  by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabé cannot standas  next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering  you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other  charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the  remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply,i will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for  this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr;Morris Thomson. I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and  that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail through the above email.  PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT REQUEST.  Yours Faithfully,  DR.AME BENJAMIN  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/

36	Independent Committee of  Eminent Persons (ICEP),London.  Email:kcole444@yahoo.co.uk        ATTENTION:        I am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),London.  ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.     It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.   These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.  The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP)have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54 ,000 in December, 1999.    The published lists contain all types of dormant  accounts,including interest-bearing savings accounts,  securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.  Numbered accounts are also included.Interest is  paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens.  A dormant account of Hami Ramzy with a credit balance of 15,800,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me.    The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs.    The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of  Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased benefi ciaries who died interstate living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch.   The funds will be banked in the Holland, London or Spain, being a safe for funds and we  can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.  Due to the sensitive nature of my job,   I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.    All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.  Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax.   For the fund to be transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name and country via any of the corresponding banks in London or Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world.   My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 pe r cent of the total amount.    THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED, The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting  submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.  Thanking you in anticipation for your prompt response.      Regards,  Dr Kenneth cole.      ___________________________________  The Student Zone http://www.thestudentzone.com     
53	   Hello,   I write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal involving US$ 3.5M.This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year by this branch of the International Commercial Bank which I am the manager. I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for the year 2005 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of this excess. I have since then, placed this amount on a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary.  Upon your response, I will configure your name on our database as holder of the Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of the funds to your designated bank account.  If you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 30% of the funds while 70% shall be for me.   Kindly forward your response to: toneyak05@yahoo.es   With Regards, Anthony Aka       
49	Re: Your Kind Attention Needed  Dear Friend,  My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in   London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a   Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million   Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a   plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30,   2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting   his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit,   but none has surfaced.  The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for   such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by   the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing   up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind   understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for   our mutual benefit.  If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is   assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the   deceased which contains every needed information about the account and   the deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have   enough information to support you in claiming the inheritance.  The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after   expenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on   chriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for   the claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten   working days.  Please kindly get back to me urgently so that we will discuss more on   this issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and   fax numbers for easier communication.  Best Regards, Chris Swales Email:chriswales@katamail.com

30	Dear Friend,  Good day. I decided to contact you after I went through my father�s file.  Hence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.  My name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy  farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my  country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert   mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have  become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and  a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of  brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.  Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he   deposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) with a  security company,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal  trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company  organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and  chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and  Swaziland.  The government seized my father�s farms and bank account before his Murder.  He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This  is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country,  so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment  of the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your  assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the  government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge  sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such  investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can  assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.   As I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this information as top secret. Then u can also contact me through this  alternative mail (mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au)  Yours Sincerely, Mr.Desmond Martin.  _________________________________________________________________ Testez Windows Llive Mail Beta !  http://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f

67	   Good day,      I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago.  I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the subject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.  In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process.  Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited with the security firm.  The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and we got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of that particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful; we�ve used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased.  What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those that occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.  My proposal: I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you the beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 (Six Million United states Dollar); I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 60/40.I would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.   I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously.  Do not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private email: davbryan00@sify.com  I await your response.  David Bryan

BANK WEBSITE:www.bkofafrica.net  Dear Friend,  I am the manager of auditing and accounting department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$20.5m dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. RICHARD BURSON from Florida, U.S.A) who died along with his entire family on November 1999 in a plane crash.For more informations about the crash you can visit this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/502503.stm  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you,so that the money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a text of application that i will send to you,but before i send to you the text of application form,I will like you to send me the following informatios  1.NAME IN FULL:................................ 2.ADDRESS:....................................... 3.NATIONALITY:................................... 4.AGE:............................................. 5.Sex.............................................. 6.OCCUPATION:...................................... 7.MARITAL STATUS:.................................. 8.PRIAVTE PHONE NO............................................ 9.PRIVATE FAX NO:.............................................  so i will like you to send to me those informations for easy and effective communication.

30	 CAN I CONFIDE IN YOU?     CAN YOU HELP US INVEST OUR LATE FATHER'S FUND?????   Dearest Beloved,   Please kindly go through this letter before you pass judgment because I am in  need of assistance from a God fearing and trustworthy person. I am Mr. Sayid Mustafa the son of late Dr. Malik Mustafa  from Sierra Leone. I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this  proposal   My late father happens to be in control of a large number of farms including cattle’s and many sheep before he was poisoned by his foreign business partners in Paris with my mother in one of their farmers association meeting because of greed.    But before his death my late father deposited some amount of money outside our country in a bank at the tone of Four Million United States Dollars $4,000.000.00. So I and my little sister were no longer safe here as the present government of  Sierra Leone are working with almost all the  killers of my late father and were looking a way to kill us too as one of them has  just been made a minister, name undisclosed because of security reasons.   Furthermore we have contacted the bank where the money was deposited and the bankers let us understand that they signed an agreement with our late father that the total money must be transferred into his foreign business partner account undisclosed to them ,therefore because of this reason the money will not be released to us until the foriegn partner of my late father comes for the claim of the money or we should present to them the partner of our late father and that is the major reason why i am contacting you now for assistance so that you can contact the bank as my late father's foriegn partner.   All i need  from you now  if you have accepted  and willing to help us  when replying is your full names and address including your direct and personal telephone number for easy communication as you know that this transaction is a very confidential one and also assure me that you are really ready to assist us.   Please Kindly get back to me immediately after you must have gone through my message fill free and make it urgent because we are in a very difficult situation now.  I am offering you 15 % of the total money amount, if you accept to help us transfer this money and in case of any necessary expenses you might incur during this transaction.   N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free which I can invest with this money when it is transferred from the bank here, personally I am interested in estate management and hotel business, please advise me. For more explanation and convinction from me please write me through my   alternative e-mail address  wich i normally check (mustafa2007@jmail.co.za  ) or call me with this number +225 05519264.    Please note that this is a very important  to us and if really you will like to help us in this transaction we plead that you help us with your heart and sincerity and promise me and  my younger sister to be a good guardian considering our situation and not to betray us because we believed that Good people still exist..     We are really hoping to hear from you soonest and it will be our greatest joy to know that you have accepted and willing to handle this transaction till the end.   Thanks and God bless you and your family.   Best regards   Mr.Sayid Mustafa         Windows Live Spaces : Partagez vos photos des fêtes sur votre blog Messenger! 
45	  Attn :.........              RE: TRANSFER OF 156,000,000. 00    I am quite Sure that this mail Will come to you as a surprise Since I have not been having previous correspondences with you.  First, let me start by introducing myself as Mr. Andy Hornby, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, here in London, England.One of our accounts, with holding balance of 156,000,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Six Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation,the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view this CNN website .   http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/  The account has no beneficiary and no other person knows about this account.  I am in close contact with the bank manager here who is my partner and is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner. The account has no writen or oral WILL attached to it. I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money if you agree to receive this fund in your account pending my arrival in your country for sharing and on receipt of your Bank Account Details where the fund will be transferred.   We will start with FIFTY SIX MILLION POUNDS. At the end, 65% will be for me, 25% for you and 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred on both sides during the transfer.Another 5% will go to the charity. There is no risk involved as every arrangement has been perfected.    YOU CAN CONTACT ME.

70	Hello dear  From, Miss ZACHI Medina Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire  West Africa.  Hello Dear Chosen one,  Please excuse me for all the inconveniences my mail could cause you.I  saw your profile and have the intrest on you . Please  even if we never  knew before, I believe firmly that on the basis of the right of  humanitarian assistance that a real confidence and love can arise from  our communication and  also a real partnership between  us.   I am Miss Medina ZACHI , the legitimate daughter of the Director of  cocoa export here murdered by the rebelles here because of the  political crisis going on here since four years ago.   My father had deposited a consignment  with a  security company here   containing the sum of  $9.000,000 USD (Nine million dollars USD) To  allow him to conceive a project of investment at the end of his mandate  here.   Regrettably the fate decided on it otherwise.   Today my major concern  is to move out  this sum outside here. Given  that I am the only child and I have seriously suffered from the  raggings and the harassments on behalf of the political opponents of my  Father.

48	Dear Friend,   I am captain James .W. Brian in the US Marine Corps on Monitoring and Peace a  keeping mission in Baghdad-Iraq. The reason why I am explaining  my finding  to you is to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes  immensely to the actualization of my dreams.   On the 18th day of March 2007, we were alerted on the presence of some  terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street, a long thoroughfare of high-rise  buildings built by Saddam Hussein here in Baghdad.   After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours, we were able  to  capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and  over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters  linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent  investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al  Qaeda and some are for Ayman al-Zawahiri and they took us to  some of their  hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through  the capital.   When we invaded into the hideout, we recovered several guns, amour including  some boxes among which two contains bullets, one filled with  hard  drugs  (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars  which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent  investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted.   I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have  the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me  on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that  ital&#8482;s no problem.   This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with  me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place.   I am now in keen need of a "Reliable and Trustworthy" person like you who  would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars for  me  untill my assignment elapses here.   I assure and promise to give you 20% of this fund, however feel free to  negotiate what you wish to have as your percentage in this deal.   Please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret to protect my job with  the US Monitoring and Peace-Keeping mission. please you can  contact me with  my private mailbox......  capt.james_brianusmarine5@yahoo.com   My Sincere regards,  Capt James Brian.(U.S MARINE)   
51	   --  From: Mustapha Benson Address: Banjul The Gambiaa Telephone Nos: 00220 9897219 Email: muspham6@hotmail.com Or muspham@safe-mail.net                                           MANAGING DIRECTOR.   Dear Sir,  I am Mr Musatapha Accounts supervisor with National Bank,Freetown, Sierra  Leone. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On  June 6, 1999, a Foreign Diamond consultant/contractor with the Sierra Leonean  National Diamond Corporation, Mr.Simon Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)  Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at SD$27,000,000.00, (Twenty-Seven  Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to  his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and  finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Sierra Leanean National  Diamond Corporation that Mr. Simon Kelly died from a rebel attack. On further  investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all  attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further  investigation and discovered that Mr. Simon Kelly did not declare any kin or  relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork  in my Bank. This sum of USD$27,000,000.00 has carefully/confidentially been  moved out of my bank to a Finance security company in the Gambia for  safekeeping. No one can ever come forward to claim it. According to Sierra  Leonean Law, at the expiration of 8 (eight) years,the money will revert to the  ownership of the Sierra Leone Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I want you as a Foreigner to stand in as the  rightful owner of the money. I deposited it in a security company in two trunk  boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I  tagged them to be photographic materials for export. In the circumstance, I  want to present you as the rightful owner of the boxes in the security company  so that you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is  simple. I would like you to provide immediately your full names and address as  well as your direct telephone and fax number so that the Attorney will prepare  the necessary documents which will put you in the right place as the owner of  the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to your country and share in the  ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you. There is no risk at all as all the  paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction on your behalf, please  reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you  understand the transaction and swing into the necessary action while I confide  in you hoping you will not betray me at last.  Thanks and God bless    Mr Musatapha  ____________________ http://www.email.si/

57	FROM THE DESK OF MR MUSSA  SANI BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER bANK OF AFRICA. OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO. PRIVATE TEL: +226678817532                                                             TOP SECRET  Dear Friend  I am  MR MUSSA  SANI   the bill and exchange manager at the foreign  remittance department of BANK OF AFRICA.  I got your contact from the internet ,while seaching for an honest and trust  worthy person, who will assist me to implement this transfer. l discovered  the sum of Twenty Two million and five hundred thousand United States  Dollars (USD22.5M) belonging to a deceased customer of this bank.  The fund has been lying in a suspence account without anybody coming to put  claim over the money since the account owner late Mr Salla khatif from  Lebanese , who was involved in the December 25th 2003 Benin plane crash.  Here is the air crash website on cnn =  http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html The said  fund is now ready for transfer to a foriegn account whose owner will be  portrayed as the beneficiary and next of kin to the deceased customer of the  bank.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next if  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I therefore soliciting  for your assistance to come forward as the next of kin,  I have agreed that 40% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary in  respect of the provision of your Account and services rendered, 55% would be  for me while 5% will be for expencses incured during the cause of thIS  transaction If the money is transferred to your Account from BANK OF AFRICA,  I and my family in this transaction will proceed immediately to your country  for our own share of the money.  I expect you to keep this business strictly confidential and secret as you  may wish to know that I am Bank official. Be rest assured that this business  is 100% riskfree on both side and every arrangement to transfer this money  to the Account you are going to provide have been concluded provided we  maintain the confidentiality and secreceirity involved.  Contact me on my email address I am looking forward for your prompt  response.  Yours faithfully, MR MUSSA  SANI  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Messenger : appels gratuits de PC à PC !  http://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f

60	FROM MR CAMPBELL WILLIAM Tel/Fax: 44 703 189 2908  MANCHESTER (WA) 20515    Greetings,    As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will die someday.  My name is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.    I have since lost my power of speech and can only manage to write now, as that has been the only way I am able to communicate. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that is the only thing I cared for    But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.    I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and South Africa, they refused and kept the money to themselves.    Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I have left for them. The last of my money which only few of them knows of is the huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank in ABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. waiting for reply.

The Government in South Africa gave him those lands for farming and he will pay back when he have the money, it was like a loan they gave him the lands as loan My father was very successful In the farming business and he paid all the Government back. Some top officials In the Government were Jealous because of his wealth.

I contacted the Security company yesterday on how I could collect the funds with my lawyer assistance and they told me that I need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa because of Security reasons. And I don�t have anyone outside Africa that will stand for me as a beneficiary.  They said the money was too big (TWENTY MILLION USDOLLARS)My father never  told me the amount of the money I was so shock. They also said that the funds has been deposited there for about four years  now and it has accumulated demurrage which we must pay before the consignment will be released.

35	 Dear Friend,   I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria.  Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further want his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas agent.  I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry.  The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire estates in your country. As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan. That was how we lost US$7.5Million.  So this time around , I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal, through my email.  After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of personalities involved. Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.   Best Regards,   Dr.Mohammed Azeez.

48	FROM: DAVID KUBA. NO.10 ANDERSON STREET JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA TEL: +27-83-9470181 FAX: +27-865173471 EMAIL: kubafamily001@yahoo.com ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.   ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.                              STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL  You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID KUBA,the first SON of MR.PEDRO KUBA,a farmer and leader movement for Democratic change  (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.  I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to  write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$40 M(FOURTY  MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals  for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem  came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act which  wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, alot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.  It is against this  background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's  money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.  I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money  in South Af rica  for fear of going through the same experience  in future since both countries have similar political history. Moreover,the South  African Foreign Exchange policy  does  not allow such investment as an  asylum seeker. As a business man,whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his hands,I must let  you know that this transaction is risk free. If  you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas.  This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I  have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the proccess of this transaction.  If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, You should keep this transaction secret and confidential. And send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication.  N/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following: 1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS. 2) YOUR FULL NAME. 3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.  THANKS FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION DAVID KUBA (FOR THE FAMILY)

ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with  his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about  the crash you can visit this site:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision  of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the  immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the  bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will be remitted.

70	AB 01 COCODY Treshville  Abidjan   My Name is Miriam; I worked as a maid to Mr. ROBERT BUTLER an American, who used to be a contractor with an oil servicing company based here in Cote D’Ivoire. Last year,{Jan. 2006} my master died of a serious illness, but before his death, he told me in confidence of a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27,000,000.00) which he concealed in two trunk boxes and  deposited with a finance House in Cote D’Ivoire. However, the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk to be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for export.   Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health, he was afraid that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me that if he dies, I should try everything within my capability to make sure that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less privileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this deposit to me with a written instruction.    I have contacted the finance house over this issue, but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me, unless I bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLER'S relatives. This is a very tough situation for me, because since I lived with my master, he has not mentioned any of his family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you to the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining.   If you can handle this with me, kindly respond back immediately and we will negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.  Thanking you for your cooperation.

I am Mr. Mazuri Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got your contact through the internet network online hence I decided to write you.   Before the death of my father, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 25.5Million (Twenty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, in one of the private security/finance companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited in the security / finance company as family valuables and consignment to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines/ farm machineries and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm   in Swaziland because he is the chairman of the farmers association while Mum was the treasurer.   This land problem came ( and is still on )  when our President Mr. Robert  Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some few black  farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both in the CNN and BBC.   It is against this background that, I and my family  who are currently staying in South Africa now decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees(political asylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be involved in any financial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything.    All I seek for is your seriousness, for I am entrusting my future and that of my family into your hands .I must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you accept to assist my family and me all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg - South Africa (if possible), so that you can help me   open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in   transferring the money into any account you will nominate outside South Africa . This money I intend to use for investment in a good business venture.  I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable business investment of the money in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I will also map out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will remain for me and my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with my alternative e-mail address  E-mail:martins.mazuri1@webmail.co.za above for faster communication.   Finally, please give this matter the urgent attention it deserves as I am in dire need to leave this country. Kindly send me your private phone and fax number for easy communication.   Best regards, Mr.Mazuri Martins (For the Family)

This money  had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA, hence  the money was only accepted  and registered by the bank while it was kept in the  Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be.   I have sinceconfirmed  with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this  money has been in this account untouched!    Now,how do you come in and what is your business with all this? I am sure this  is the question you would be asking me?   Simple, As the personal lawyer to late  Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my  Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your  co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio  Montoya.  After proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be  transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late  Antonio Montoya. How do we do it?  The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's  vault is kept in my Law Chambers.   I, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio  Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary  of this money kept in the bank's vault.  I will submit the Will/Last Testament to  the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank  account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further  administration to other members of the family.   I am the Executor of late  Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to  include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce  you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without  delays.  I am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too.The mode of  sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this  transaction. What do you think about this?  While I look forward to hearing from you soon,absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction.   Thank you and God bless you.      Barrister Gareth Jones.

On 14th of Feb 1997, my client was   involved in a car accident Along Place Independence Road, Senegal, All   occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I   have been trying to locate any of his relative or Next of Kin, but to   no avail, After all unsuccessful attempts to locate any of his   relatives, I decided to contact you to assist in repatriating the   money left behind by my client before they get confiscated by the   security company where this huge deposit($21million), was fixed.

34	   CAPITEC BANK LTD. ROODEPOORT BRANCH, JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. Private Email:a_chriss36@yahoo.gr   Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Chris Adriaan credit officer of Capitec Bank Ltd.I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Mr. Hassian Hussein who was an Iraqi Business Man and also Deals On Arms With The South African Government made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Nineteen million five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only ($19.5m) in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even during the war, again after the war several notifications were sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Mr. Hassian Hussein and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home in Iraq. After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hassian Hussein did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate/Administration in your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the Attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication, you can write me via my private box and i will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. Kindly send your reply to: a_chriss36@yahoo.gr  Kind Regards,  Mr. Chris Adriaan.

Since the death of my husband and my 15 year old daughter things have not been thesame.        We managed to get ourselves in the Chavakachcheri division of Jaffna peninsula where we have been in a camp with more or less to eat and drink. I have been making some arrangement to leave here with my son and relocate to another country but it is not easy because i have no money with me. I have a consignment which contains cash and other valuables that my late husband always told me about that he deposited in a security firm in Europe which i will require your assistance to get so that i could make haste and  leave this war torn zone. I really need the content of this consignment because for you to get out of here safely you have to pay heavy money to the rebels so that they will guide you safely to a safe zone and i have nothing on me to do that that is why i contacted you to assist me get the consignment so that i could make arrangements to leave this place.        At the moment my only means of communication is through my late husband's laptop which i have with me here {because there is free internet connection around here} as we do not have access to telephone and are afriad of leaving this camp because of constant shelling and fighting outside. Please i will like you to assist me to have a safe and better life and also for many more others that are here whom i want to help get out of here too.        I will inform you more when i hear from you.     God Bless  Mrs. Ganeshwary Ajith Kumar

I assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity.  After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that God has a way of helping who is in need.  I am (MUSTAFA BRUNU  Esq),the Head of file Department in BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). In  my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21, 2003) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  µ release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relative on to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines,  But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set  aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my  woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement  according to the percentages indicated.

46	  My name is Sandra Williams from United Kingdom, I am 18 years old. My letter might come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not meet in person for the first time or even being in correspondence before, but I believe it takes just a day to know some either physically or by correspondence. I believe that it takes a day to know some one either physically or by correspondence. I got your email address from the internet and decided to seek for your urgent assistance as I am having a big problem with my stepmother since after the death of my father.   some months ago my father died from Heart operation. I am making this contact to you in respect of 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds, which I inherited from my late father. My late father was an  International OIL dealer. My problem actually started when my stepmother called me and said that I must submit to her and her Children the deposit Certificate of 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds,  which my late father gave me as a proof that he really deposited the money in a bank, I refused to submit the Deposit Certificate to them because the money was legally "WILLED" to me by my late father before he died, but out of greediness they want to use intimidation to take away the Deposit Certificate from me and then claim the money on their own.  since the death of my father, my stepmother and her Children has being Threatening to kill me if I do not give them the Deposit Certificate of the 10, 000,000.00 British Pounds, which I  inherited from my late father for my future survival. They seized my International passport and bit hell out of me because of the Deposit Certificate, but I refused to surrender the Deposit  Certificate to them because they also inherited majority of my late father's wealth including his companies. Their desire is to frustrate my life because I don't use to be in good terms with them because of past history concerning the death of my mother, I was told that my stepmother used her friend to poison my mother in other to become the only wife, so because of the story I heard  about the death of my mother, I ran away from the family house in other to protect the deposit certificate and my life from my wicked stepmother and her Children whose desire is to take away  my legal right and let me go as tray.   Now, I need as urgent as possible a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can receive this money for me in his or her country pending when I will arrange another International passport to  visit the person in his or her country for investment as I wish to run away from the country in other to secure my life from my wicked stepmother and her children who are now hunting me like a  prey. I wish to run to another country and settle down with the money as they use to say that prevention is better than cure, so I wish to protect my life for better tomorrow. At the present  time, I am in a hiding place arranging myself for traveling outside the country.  If you can help me in this my time of sorrow, I promise to reward you with 20% of the total sum, while 80% will be kept for me into your personal bank account pending my arrival to your country. Please help me to safe guide my only hope for survival. I am looking forward for your sincere and honest assistance to me.

36	FROM: DAVID PEDRO. NO.1023 MATIMA STREET FREE STATE, SOUTH AFRICA TEL: +27.785709710 EMAIL: davpe@myway.com  ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO.   STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL  You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the first SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new  Land Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed  because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.  I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in  South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since  both countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African  Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker.  As a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his  hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept  to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into  partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your  country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have  also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the  process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I

As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconstructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some soldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a friend whom I have known for 12 years.   On the 27th day of March 2007, at about 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where there is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded to a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guided by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick the metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one another which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of them.    Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and some boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollars and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes owned and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri.   I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out of the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors.   I am now in desperate need of a “Reliable and Trustworthy” person like you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot afford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as everything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my picture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with.   I assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the alluvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within you so that my job would not be jeopardized.     My Sincere Regards, Jonathan Charles.

69	    From . Mr. Moreno Garcia.  Date: 21 - 06 -2007.  Kindest Attention:  My name is Mr. Moreno Garcia. I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and   right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for   anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I   would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few   close friends   .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have   decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there   to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use it to help those in Need.  N/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and time.  I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.  God be with you.  Mr. Moreno Garcia.

I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal, now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal.     I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October   1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:  (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB.     My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America, Canada, Africa, Europe and Asian Countries.     This mission, who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $7,300,000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country, and i have map out $1,700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work.      Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore, I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use, than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.     Lastly, I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity.     I await your reply.  Mrs. Saleh Galal

I am writing this letter to you to intimate you of a pending transaction I want to execute with you privately. Anyway I got your contact through one of the Internet Reference Directories in my Chambers. One of my valued clients - Mr. Antonio Montoya died together with his lovely wife Late Antonio Montoya died on the Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200, which was enroute to Los Angeles from Boston during the terrorist attack on America back in 2001.   I was his personal lawyer and the Executor of his Will. There are no further traces of any of his next-of-kin in his native Country. As his personal lawyer and Executor of his Will, I know late Antonio Montoya kept about GBP 9.2 million in the Vaults of a bank here in London.  This money had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA; hence the money was only accepted and registered by the bank while it was kept in the Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be.   I have since confirmed with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this money has been in this account untouched!    Now, how do you come in and what is your business with all this? I am sure this is the question you would be asking me?   Simple, As the personal lawyer to late Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio Montoya.   After proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late Antonio Montoya. How do we do it?  The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's vault is kept in my Law Chambers.   I, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary of this money kept in the bank's vault.   I will submit the Will/Last Testament to the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further administration to other members of the family.   I am the Executor of late Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without delays.  I am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too. The mode of sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this transaction. What do you think about this?  While I look forward to hearing from you soon, absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction.   Thank you and God bless you.      Barrister Gareth Jones.

In order to transfer the sum of (US$17.5M) seventeen million five hundred thousand united state dollars which was deposited in their bank by some top government officials  into any reliable foreign bank account. I was mandated to search for an honest partner abroad who can work jointly with us to achieve this great opportunity.   Those funds was deposited in there bank in 2002 by some African top politicians who used their position in their offices to embezzle government treasury some of those politicians ran away from their country as soon as new government took over power to avoid probing them for their misappropriation and embezzlement of government funds. The new government in power has ordered for the confiscation of their properties including their bank accounts for their evil operation. From my discussions with the senior director before contacting you he told me that financial authority will be visiting their bank by next month for investigation however I was convinced that the deal must be successful and risk free as the funds will be transferred secretly to your account without hitch I promise not to relate this deal to any other person till I hear from you. Beer in mind that none of us will like to be involved in any kind of business that will stain or jeopardize his position in the offic e as we all have names to protect in the society. note that all mechanism has been mapped out for the actualization of this project.   This project will be concluded within 7_14 bank working days from the day we start the process. I will give you more details and the next step as soon as I confirm your ability and interest to participant in this project. My assurance to you is that this project will not effect or harm you as we will provide all the necessary documents that will cover the transfer to your account. What I need from you is to provide an existing bank account or set up a new account were the money will be transferred to in your name considering the source of the funds you are entitled to 25% for your assistance while 70% will be for us as the originator of the deal while 5% will be kept aside for any expenses that we may encore on the process of arranging the necessary documents that will help us facilitate the deal .

Since we  got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless his next of kin or relative applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in my department now  decided to excape with the fund,and as such we vial to make this business proposal to you so that my bank will release the fund into your account as the next of kin to our bank deceased customer for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for claims and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury.  Infact i know the fund will not even go into the bank treasury,but our top bank officials(directors)will only share it among themselves into their accounts.  The Banking law and guideline here in burkina faso stipulates that if any customer account or property remains unserviceable or dormant,and unclaimed after five years, the account will be confiscated and transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,inrespect to the provision of a foreign account,and your imense contribution to champion the course of transfering the fund to your  account.  10 % will be set aside forexpenses incurred by the both party during the business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.  There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable my bank transfer the fund into your account,i will send to you the text of application which you will send to my bank as next of kin to the deceased customer and that will be when you indicate your interest in the business, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of our bank deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted .  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction  is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required informations will be perfectly made for you to champion the course of the transaction with my bank without any hitch or risk .  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.  Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your’s sincerely,  DR ASINTHE NIGNAN.  BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER(BOA  Hotmail to go?

53	From: Mr.Jonathan Mutambara. JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. Email:  jomutambara@fsmail.net. Websites:http://www.absa.co.za  Dear Friend,    Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Jonathan Mutambara, In  charge of Credit and Foreign bills of my Bank, AMALGAMATED BANK OF  SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).   I  have an obscured business suggestion for you.  One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued  $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not  been operated for the past six years.       >From my investigations and  confirmations, the owner  of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a  citizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight  AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your  perusal you can view this web site:http://news.bbc.co. uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything  as  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members  who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.  Also  Information from the National Immigration stated  that he was also  single on entry into South Africa.    I have secretly discussed this  matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable  foreign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal  alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually  raise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we  still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a  second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of  kin with informations which will be made available to you.   This  transaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate  and does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any  other illegal act.      The sharing of the fund between us, is as  follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and  commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my  colleague's.    Forward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net     Best  Regards,  Mr.Jonathan Mutambara Email: jomutambara@fsmail.net

I was a member of the Abuja National stadium building and organizing Committee of the just concluded "ALL AFRICAN GAMES" which was organized and hosted by Nigeria but before now I have been a director of sports in the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development.     We were appointed over 3 years ago to supervise the building of the ultra modern Abuja National Stadium, putting in place all equipments needed for the completion of the stadium which is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world today and also involved in the planning and hosting of the games. This project cost the government of Nigeria Millions of dollars.  The stadium project has been completed; all equipments put in place and Commissioned and used for the All African Games tagged "ABUJA 2003". The accounts have been rendered to the government satisfactorily and we have received commendations for a job well done.     During the construction, planning and execution of this project, as the Chairman of contract award committee I was able to make some money for myself through contract that was awarded to Dewolfgang Gmbh, which I over-invoiced to the tune of USD18.5M with the help of Dewolfgang Gmbh the original contractor.     All I want you to do is to assist me in clearing this amount while standing in as the owner and director of Vacknol Nigeria International Limited in whose name I made as the beneficiary of the funds. Vacknol Nigeria International Limited is an international company and could have a company anywhere in the world the most important thing been that it is registered here in Nigeria as a limited liability company in line with the company and allied matters decree of Nigeria which I have since done, I have also in my possession some contract document which will act as proof that Vacknol Nigeria International Limited executed the contract as a sub contractor under the Dewolfgang Gmbh who is the major contractor that executed the contract that was over -invoiced.     On the payment of this money to you as the supplier in the name of Vacknol Nigeria International limited because I will apply for the transfer in this name, and you as the director of the company. I will come to meet with you so that we can both sit down and discuss further, what kind of business we will enter into or if need be expand your already existing business, but actually I hope to establish a five star hotel and go into real estate development as these are life time businesses that I know are of high yields interest any where in the world.     I know you will be entitled to some percentage of this money as Compensation for your efforts, please feel free to indicate what you will take from this amount, as this is very important to me before we commence proceedings.     I will tell you more about this when I hear from you. I will give you every detail of what we are to do.

49	 Dear Sir,   With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this proposal believing that it will receive the most desired attention from you even as we have not had any previous correspondence, Although, I am constrained by insufficient information about you, but I will express in full the main objectives of this proposal .   I am Mr.CHRIS ANDERSON Personal Aide and in-law to the former President of the Liberian Mr. Charles Taylor, who resigned his post due to pressure from the International Community in order to maintain peace in west African Region. His Excellency who is currently behind bars at a U.N.-backed court in Hague Netherlands, facing 11 counts of war crimes during the country's 1991-2002 civil war. Liberian Government In conjunction with Sierra Leone Government has agreed on June 20, 2006 for security reason to Hand him over to U.N War crime Special Court in Hague, Netherlands.   His Excellency who was arrested on a boarder between Nigeria  and Cameroun of which he instructed me to escape with all his vital documents so that he could face a U.N.-backed tribunal for war crime charges which he is now currently facing. but before this new unfolding events. Though our original plan was after successful crossing to Cameroun un-noticed, I will proceed to Accra Ghana totake the task of arranging for the immediate evacuation of the money in whish he deposited in the custody of Security Finance Company before it will be discovered by International Community or Liberian Government.See the website for more details  http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-charles-taylor-captured.php http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2963086.stm http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html http://somalinet.com/news/world/Africa/10893   His Excellency, while in jail has mandated me to secure the co-operation of a trust worthy and reliable firm or individual as fund managers to whom he will entrust certain amount of money to be managed within the period while he is in jail, on the terms as shall be agreed by both parties. The new government in Liberia lead by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sir leaf has initiated moves to probe Mr. Taylor’s governance while in office with a view of recovering his assets and deposits and repatriating such to the country as was the case with the Late Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha as advised by the International Community on Liberian Government.   On the wake of hostilities in Liberia and the break out of war between the rebels and the allied forces, the Liberian government being under an arms embargo by the U.N could not import arms officially, so Mr. Taylor resolved to illegal arms deal from the West African Region of Ghana, which was transacted by cash monies, within this period, he succeeded in depositing a total sumof USD$115M only, in cash money derived from the arms dealing custody of Security Finance Company in Accra Ghana. Which is the trust company from where the arms deal was financed?   we intends to execute a deed of conveyance of this deposit to a capable and trust worthy firm or individual who will immediately effect a change of beneficiary on the deposit and release it from the custody of Security Finance Company by way of terminating the deposit contract to avoid any trace and repatriation of the deposit by the new government in Liberia.   Terms of the transaction shall be discussed and agreement entered into when you indicate your ability to handle and manage funds of this magnitude under a strict confidential understanding.. Please treat as most confidential due to the sensitive information given in here strictly to you.   Yours sincerely CHRIS ANDERSON Personal Aide to the former Liberian President

PLANE CRASH WEB SITE...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm.                            ("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS                                    CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")      Compliments Of The Season,        Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent and writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional data base found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity.          After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that God has a way of helping who is in need.        I am (Ben Coroma),the Head of file Department in African development bank (ADB).   In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.   Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.   You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.   Your’s faithfully,    Ben Coroma.  FROM (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.

63	         Phone +2773-400-4485 Fax    +2711-507-5946  ATTN: DIRECTOR/CEO.  I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South Africa {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person, you can contact this website: http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incur during transactions.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  My private Phone +27-73-400-4485 or Fax +27-11-507-5946.  I wait for your quick response.  Kindest regards,  ALBERT SITHOLI.

The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of Kin to the deceased or have the fund confisicated  by the end of this year. For the fact that I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since you come from the same country with my client, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you.        Therefore, on my receipt to your positive response, we shall discuss on the modus operandi of the transaction/transfer.

59	   FROM MR.MAZURI MARTINS JOHANESSBURG,2001 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA. PHONE+27 73 130 8560                                              STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   Sir/Madam,  You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr. Mazuri Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got your contact through the internet network online hence I decided to write you.  Before the death of my father, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 25.5Million (Twenty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, in one of the private security/finance companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited in the security / finance company as family valuables and consignment to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines/ farm machineries and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm   in Swaziland because he is the chairman of the farmers association while Mum was the treasurer.  This land problem came ( and is still on )  when our President Mr. Robert  Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some few black  farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both in the CNN and BBC.  It is against this background that, I and my family  who are currently staying in South Africa now decided to transfer my father�s money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees(political asylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be involved in any financial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything.  All I seek for is your seriousness, for I am entrusting my future and that of my family into your hands .I must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you accept to assist my family and me all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg � South Africa (if possible), so that you can help me   open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in   transferring the money into any account you will nominate outside South Africa . This money I intend to use for investment in a good business venture.  I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable business investment of the money in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I will also map out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will remain for me and my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with my alternative e-mail address above for faster communication.  Finally, please give this matter the urgent attention it deserves as I am in dire need to leave this country. Kindly send me your private phone and fax number for easy communication.  Best regards, Mr.Mazuri Martins (For the Family)

View this website for verification http://www.cwn.org.uk/business/a-z/a/agco/2002/01/020104-air-crash.htm   Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with.   My proposition to you, is to seek your consent to present you as the Next of kin and beneficiary of this late client, So that the proceeds of this account valued a huge sum shall be paid to you, and then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 30% for you,While 60% for me and others involved, 10% shall be used for miscelenious expenses while the remainder shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is owned by a deceased person.

42	 Salutation, c'est avec respect et humilité que je vous j'écris pour solliciter de votre haute bienveillance, une assistance de grande importance. Je souhaite solliciter votre aide dans la migration et l'investissement dans votre pays  la fortune que j'ai hertitée de mon père . Brièvement, je suis une sierra léonaise agée de 22 ans et la fille unique du défunt DR Kouakou Bah Theodore. Jusqu'à sa mort, mon père était le Directeur général d'une société d'extraction d'or et de diamant dans la région de Kanema en Sierra Leone. Le 6 Avril 2002 les forces militaires fidèles au gouvernement d'Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH ont envahi la mine de diamant et d'or et ont assassiné mon père, le confondant avec son frère kouakou Sankoh qui est le député du (RUF) du révolutionnaire FODAY SANKOH.Quand ma mère, absente car venu me voir en côte d'ivoire où j'étudie dans une grande école a appris la nouvelle ,elle est retounée au pays malgré tous les risques et a récupéré certaines des affaires qu'elle jugeait sacrées pour mon père dans notre villa de famille. Parmi les objets récupérés figurait un dossier contenant des détails d'un dépôt que mon père a fait dans une société de compagnie de sécurité à Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire.  Il y a déposé $ 10.500.000,00 (Dix millions cinq cent mille de dollars des États-Unis) contenus dans une (1) boîte de tronc à son nom. Il n'a pas révélé le vrai contenu de la boîte à cette société. Néanmoins il  a déclaré le dépôt comme biens de famille pour des raisons de sécurité. C'est l'argent que mon defunt père a gagné à partir de la vente de l'or et de diamants pendant son temps comme Directeur général.  Compte tenu du climat politique instable en Cote d´Ivoire , j'ai décidé de chercher un partenaire afin d'investir cette somme hors de la Côte D'ivoire dans des domaines rentables,  c'est donc la raison pour laquelle je viens vers vous pour solliciter votre assistance et nous aider à investir dans votre pays. La meilleure méthode pour conclure cette transaction vue la tension politique en cote d´Ivoire, serait d'expédier la caisse contenant les fonds dans votre pays . La compagnie de sécurité a la possibilité de nous faciliter les choses en expédiant cette caisse dans votre pays par la voie diplomatique que j'apprécie beaucoup. Dès l'arrivée de ces fonds dans votre pays, vous allez les récupérer et les sauvegarder et engager les démarches pour nous aider à venir s'établir dansvotre pays. Ici en raison de sa proximité à notre pays et de la guerre, notre statut de réfugié ici ne peut pas faciliter les affaires pour nous.  Nous vous demandons également de rechercher des affaires fiables et lucratives, de sorte que nous puissions investir sagement. Nous avons à l'esprit de vous donner 15 % de toute la somme (10.500.000,00 millions de dollars $), et la part de 25% dans n'importe quel investissement que nous ferons au moment venu si vous acceptez de nous aider.  Cette fortune que nous vous avons indiquée devrait demeurer confidentielle. dans l'attente de vous lire. Au plaisir de collaborer avec vous.  Bien à vous,  Mlle  kouakou Chantal  Besoin d'un e-mail ?

Le 6 Avril 2002 les forces militaires fidèles au gouvernement d'Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH ont envahi la mine de diamant et d'or et ont assassiné mon père, le confondant avec son frère kouakou Sankoh qui est le député du (RUF) du révolutionnaire FODAY SANKOH.Quand ma mère, absente car venu me voir en côte d'ivoire où j'étudie dans une grande école a appris la nouvelle ,elle est retounée au pays malgré tous les risques et a récupéré certaines des affaires qu'elle jugeait sacrées pour mon père dans notre villa de famille. Parmi les objets récupérés figurait un dossier contenant des détails d'un dépôt que mon père a fait dans une société de compagnie de sécurité à Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire.  Il y a déposé $ 10.500.000,00 (Dix millions cinq cent mille de dollars des États-Unis) contenus dans une (1) boîte de tronc à son nom. Il n'a pas révélé le vrai contenu de la boîte à cette société. Néanmoins il  a déclaré le dépôt comme biens de famille pour des raisons de sécurité. C'est l'argent que mon defunt père a gagné à partir de la vente de l'or et de diamants pendant son temps comme Directeur général.  Compte tenu du climat politique instable en Cote d´Ivoire , j'ai décidé de chercher un partenaire afin d'investir cette somme hors de la Côte D'ivoire dans des domaines rentables,  c'est donc la raison pour laquelle je viens vers vous pour solliciter votre assistance et nous aider à investir dans votre pays. La meilleure méthode pour conclure cette transaction vue la tension politique en cote d´Ivoire, serait d'expédier la caisse contenant les fonds dans votre pays . La compagnie de sécurité a la possibilité de nous faciliter les choses en expédiant cette caisse dans votre pays par la voie diplomatique que j'apprécie beaucoup. Dès l'arrivée de ces fonds dans votre pays, vous allez les récupérer et les sauvegarder et engager les démarches pour nous aider à venir s'établir dansvotre pays. Ici en raison de sa proximité à notre pays et de la guerre, notre statut de réfugié ici ne peut pas faciliter les affaires pour nous.  Nous vous demandons également de rechercher des affaires fiables et lucratives, de sorte que nous puissions investir sagement. Nous avons à l'esprit de vous donner 15 % de toute la somme (10.500.000,00 millions de dollars $), et la part de 25% dans n'importe quel investissement que nous ferons au moment venu si vous acceptez de nous aider.  Cette fortune que nous vous avons indiquée devrait demeurer confidentielle. dans l'attente de vous lire. Au plaisir de collaborer avec vous.  Bien à vous,  Mlle  kouakou Chantal  Besoin d'un e-mail ? Créez gratuitement un compte Windows Live Hotmail et bénéficiez de 2 Go de stockage !

THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS USD$10.500,000 (TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS.)   I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK.

ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE TOTAL SUM WHILE 60% WILL BE FOR ME. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION AS SECRET AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER I CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.   I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THE BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES INDICATED ABOVE.     ALL OTHER NECESSARY INFORMATION REGARDING THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU.

Have it at the back of  your mind, that the transaction does not involve any RISK, and does not need  much engagement from you, since i am familiar with this kind of transaction  being an insider.

I am  Richard Akintunde, the Secretary/Legal Adviser of the Zambia Overseas Task Force on Foreign Payments. The Task Force was set up by President LEVY MWANAWASA of Zambia on January, 2004 with the definite assignment of verifying/ratifying all claims for settlements made by Foreign Contractors and hence effecting Payments accordingly. Our terms of reference include all Contracts executed between 1991 and 2001 when Dr. Frederick Chiluba was the President. Former President Chiluba is currently standing trial for embezzlement of public fund while in office. President MWANAWASA had to launch a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign. All the Contracts (Foreign and Indigenous) awarded under the tenure of Chiluba are being reviewed now, as there were many bogus claims. However, some claims are legitimate. At the moment, we know precisely, the Claims that are legitimate and otherwise. As soon as we concluded our review, verifications and ratifications in Lusaka, Zambia,President MWANAWASA man  dated the Task Force to   In the course of doing our work � reviewing and scrutinizing, we discovered many bogus claims. In deed, we want to pay a sum being a bogus claim into the Account of a relaible and honest person (personal or company) who will be fronted as a Foreign Contractor that satisfactorily executed a contract during Chiluba�s tenure. We have the instruments to create a perfect semblance of genuineness; hence the transaction will be hitch-free, risk free and quite beneficial to all parties involved.

61	   For your kind attention   Good-day,   you may be surprised to receive this letter from me, but it is a matter that I am convinced we can solve both, if we work together in harmony. However, I seek for your absolute confidence as I introduce myself to you. My name is AHMED HASSAN, Assistant Auditor OFFSHORE FINANCE HOME, DUBAI U.A.E.   In the discharge of my duty as the Assistant Auditor, I stumbled on this domiciliary account that has remained dormant for three years now with Ten million six hundred US dollars (US$10.6m) in it. I contacted my directors and we sent out staff for enquiries about this fund and discovered that the account holder died in an accident. I am writing you so that we can work together to remit the money to you as the next of kin because this money belongs to a foreigner and has to be claimed by a foreigner.   I guarantee this transaction under legitimate arrangements that will not bridge the law by both parties. I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money. Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money.

Presently,all the Documents concerning the FUND are with me, now that    my sickness has gone to this stage,I am scared and I want the fund to   be used for the work of God all over the world,i have prayed and told   God to direct me to an honest christian who will receive this fund and    utilise it together with me and for things that will glorify the name   of God,after my prayers,I decided to contact you alone my beloved in    Christ.      Please I will appreciate that you send the following information to   enable my late Husband Lawyer commence with the procuring of the necessary   document that will  back you up as next of kin to my late Husband for   immediate arrangement with the UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA UBA Plc on how   the Fund Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (Usd$15.5M)   will  be claimed by you on my Late Husbands Behalf as his Next of Kin and    New  Beneficiary.     1. your full name.  2.

I was Tortured and   Incarncerated for speaking out against the Devilish and Inhumane   actions of   his son Uday Hussein.    While i was working with the former President, i was entrusted with   many assets and Funds which i was keeping safe for the family, upon my   release from Prison. all the assets and funds in my possession were   all   retrieved except a certain Fund amounting to the tune of   $40,000,000.00(Forty Million United States Dollars) which is proceeds   from Crude Oil   sales of one of his numerous Oil Companies and registered with a   foreign   name under a Foreign Account and i am the only person who knows about   this Fund and also has all the necessary informations and Documents   about the account which i will give to you.    It is in view of the above facts that i am contacting you as a   foreigner to help in transferring this Money abroad into your account   as the   current restrictions on travelling and the Fact that the Funds is in a   foreigner's name under a Foreign Account therefore the Bank officials   will wellcome any foreigner with correct information about the account   which i will give to you.    Also there are other factors which has made it impossible for me to do   it as it was only possible for me to escape from Iraq to Kuwait from   where i am currently contacting you.    We are going to sign a Binding agreement of Trust to makle sure that   none of the parties involved will be cheated in the transaction as i   will   travel along with my family to your Country for sharing and   Investments as soon as the ban on travelling and other restrictions is   lifted.    You also have to note that after the successful transfer of the fund to   your account, it will be shared as follows: you will be given 35% of   the Total Fund for your services, 60% will be for me while the   remaining   5% will be for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.    I look forward to your positive and co-operative response.    Yours,    Barrister Al Mohammed El Said.

54	Dear Sir,  Naturally this letter will come to you as a surprise since we do not know each other, please permit me however to introduce myself. I am Didan Kimati, a staff of the Ministry of Finance and Economic planning here in Ghana. At the risk of boasting, I wish you to understand that I am a top personal aid to the Minister and therefore, I am privy to several pieces of information.  This aside, I am the secretary to the Contract payment committee. Subsequent upon the recent debt relief granted by the G8 Nations to the Republic of Ghana, the Government under the leadership of his Excellency, President John A. Kufour, has decided to pay off all the accumulated back-log of contract debts owed to both local and foreign contractors.  However, some of these contract debts span from the regime of his excellency, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah down to the PNDC government of Flt. Lt. John J. Rawlings and to his NDC government days even to the first tenure of President Kufour. To this effect, some of the contractors can no longer be traced as they have tried severally to receive their payment success. Obviously, some may have died.  The proposal:  I wish to implore you to come in as our partner to claim the sum of $745  Million United States Dollars which is payment due some contractors who built the Akosombo Hydro-electric dam. The contract was divided in 3 phases. The civil contractors, the water engineers and the electrical engineering companies. I understand that you may not know anything about this subject and you may not even be conversant with the procedure for building a dam. But do not worry as we have covered all the bases.  All we need to do is apply for an initial payment of $475 Million United  States Dollars for the first phase of the contract. As soon as this is successfully transferred to your account, we will apply for the other balance. You do not need to worry about the original contractors.  This has already been taken care of. We removed some of the files when we took them for review. All we have to do is replace them with your company details. As soon as this is done, we shall approve your file for immediate  payment. Once again, do not worry about this, it will be approved.  At this juncture, I wish to point out that the funds are currently deposited at the Swiss National Bank and I am currently in Geneva where I have held series of meetings with the bank officials at the Swiss National Bank who have assured me that once the neccessary documentation are in place the funds will be directly wired to the designated account. Of course we will give them something for their troubles. While I am here you may reach me on telephone number 0041225330355  We have estimated that it will take between 10 and 14 working days to complete this project. Should you wish to participate, please contact me.  You may be worried about the legitimacy of this, you may also be worried about if it were found out. The answer is do not worry, everything has been carefully thought out and planned. Should you have any questions of whatever nature, please do not hesitate to ask me. By the way, you may be worried as well, that this is a scam. There is no need for you to worry. We do sincerely hope to work this out with you.  As regards what's in it for you, we propose a sharing ratio of 60:40. 60%  for us and 40% for you. If you have any problems with this, please note that we are open to negotiations so long as they are reasonable. Do accept our heart felt good wishes as I look forward to your response.  Until I hear from you, I am with very kind regards,  Didan Kimati

Since his death occured, no body have show up as his next of kin for the claim because the account is untraceable. Upon the investigation I carried out from his records, I found out that his foreign business consultant who would have trace the account died earlier before the deceased. Therefore, this is a confidential and sealed deal.   For the success of this transaction, you should apply and act as the only existing NEXT-OF-KIN to the deceased which our bank will replace the deceased account information through proper documentation in position of your own account. This transaction is risk-free, it will never harm your good reputation in your society because no one can trace the account, and on the instant of the transfer of the fund into your account, the chapter of this transaction will be closed entirely.   Note that in a business of this nature, the bank dont want to know your difference between the deceased country, religion or believe because our bank inheritance law is against that. So, it is a preference for us achieve this success without any problem. Please note down that once the fund get transferred into your account, you will take 39% of the total sum while the rest will be for me as I will arrange myself down to your count ry to take my share.   I need your urgent response and include your private telephone/mobile numbers for easy communication.Please reply if you can be trusted in this deal.

In fact, since the Death of my late husband, their family brothers have been seriously chasing me around with my Children.constant Treats because my husband is no more with me again they tried to suppress me so that they might have the documents of his landed properties and confiscate them, They have successfully collected all his propert ies, yet they never stopped there, they told me to surrender all the belonging account of my late husband, which I did, but I never disclose to them this deposit with the security, company in Accra Ghana. Because this is where my future stand and destiny lies upon.The family of my late husband never aware of the secret existence of this deposit which I made with the security company and they can never be aware of it. Out of fear of my late husbands family, and when the situation becomes uncontrollable because of pressure on me from the Government of the Republic of Liberian, I decide to look for a trust worthy person who could assist me retrieve this box of money from the security company for onward lodgments into his account for the purpose of future investment. Consider my situation’s a widow and come to my rescue. There is need for urgent action because I'm paying $20 dollars per day as a demurrage to the security company for safe keeping of this consignment. I will send you the Authorization Certificate information’s to call them in my next mail which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave on the very day when the box of money was deposited under their company. I give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear from you soon. Contact me through my current private Email:(mrs_herrina100@hotmail.com) I wish you All the best, And God bless. Regards, Mrs. Herrina Robinson.

61	   FROM:MR MORGAN WIMPOE, 105 2ND AVE. SANDTON, 1892, JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA. PHONE+27 78 7634400   ATTN:MD/C.E.O,     Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country.Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr.Morgan Yormie Wimpoe , from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Father Mr John  Yormie  Wimpoe  former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My  Father  was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. you can verify this from these international newspaper website below:   (i) http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm   Before he was killed, my Father instructed me to escape with my family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security company and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shall come over to your country with my Family so that we can start a new life If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance  or why can't i take the cash transfer by  myself? The answer is that there  was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father  which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he  envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund.    My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.    On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $32,Million,(Thirty two million United State Dollars Only). You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction.    Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you. This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. Please reply to this email:  Sincerely,   Mr.Morgan  Wimpoe. For the family.

Je pense que vous êtes digne de la recommandation de ma prière, donc une personne honorable de confiance avec qui je peux faire des affaires. Ainsi je n'ai aucune hésitation à me fier à vous pour des affaires simples et sincères. Je suis Tiémoko Yoro Wahonon Françoise la fille unique de mes défunts parents M. et Mme Yoro Tiémoko Edmond Ivoirien d'origine Burkinabé. Mon père était un grand fermier et exploitant d'or à Abidjan la capitale économique de la Côte d’ Ivoire. Ma mère est morte quand j'étais toute petite et depuis lors mon père m'a pris en charge. Deux mois avant l'assassinat de mon père mort le 30 octobre 2006 sous mes yeux, il m'a secrètement appelé et m'a indiqué qu'il a déposé la somme de 5 millions d'Euro dans une compagnie de sécurité ici à Abidjan, Cet argent qui représente le fruit de ces années de travail devrait nous permettre de quitter le pays pour recommencer une vie loin de la politique de notre pays qui devenait dangereuse. Malheureusement mon père a été tué froidement par des hommes armés.  Présentement j'ai du fuir ma maison pour éviter d'être aussi  victime de la barbarie de ces gens, je vous écris afin que vous puissiez m'aider a retirer cet argent de la compagnie de sécurité, et le sécuriser dans votre pays. Aussi j'aimerais que vous puissiez m'aider à vous rejoindre en vue de recommencer une nouvelle vie comme souhaitée par mon défunt père. Le colis a été enregistré comme bien de famille.  La compagnie ne connaît donc pas le contenue du colis. Si vous êtes disposé à m'aider je vous ferais parvenir plus de précision afin que vous puissiez rentrer en contact avec la compagnie de sécurité. Ainsi dit, je suis disposée à vous offrir 15% de mon héritage en compensation pour votre effort après le retrait de ces fonds de la compagnie et son transfert dans votre compte bancaire. En outre, indiquez moi vos options pour m'aider sachant que pour moi, j’ai la foi que cette transaction peut se faire le plus vite possible. J’aimerais avoir votre point de vue sur cette question et cela selon votre disponibilité.

33	ATT: Sir/Madam  I am Robert Zulugan , a staff of a bank in South Africa. I will give you the name of my bank and other important information if I receive a positive reply  from you. For security reasons I cannot disclose my full identity to you now  until I am sure of your cooperation.    I work in the operations dept where I serve as account officer to numerous customers. One of the customers whom I worked as his account officer was a  wealthy diamond merchant from Australia. Because this man was good to me when he  was alive, I took it upon myself to travel to his country last month, to see if  I could locate any of his close relations. On reaching there I discovered that  his only surviving uncle died a few months back. I sponsored this trip on my own  and nobody in the bank knew I was undertaking the journey so I did not present  any official report of my findings in the bank. Now there are two things I could  do with regards to the money.    First, as his accounts officer, I could formally notify the bank authorities  that the man is dead and has no next of kin. In this case the money would be  forfeited to the government after some time. As a matter of fact this is the  proper thing I am supposed to do.    Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a foreigner, to act as  the next of kin of the late man so that he will claim the money. This is the  option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the money actually is  public fund due to the fact that my friend was a close ally to the late brutal  military president that looted government treasury. And that is why I have  chosen to do it. I want you to be my partner. All you would have to do is act as  the next of kin of the dead man and the whole money in the account will be  transferred to your account. As the accounts officer to the late man, I have all  the necessary documents that will require claiming the money in the account.The total money in the account is USD25 million. Your share will be 30%, My own share will be 70%.    Reach me immediately by email  so that I can give you further details. Also  provide me you with direct tel.number to reach you.  Yours truly,  Robert Zulugan.    Teancum Mail + LDS Branch Address Book = LDS Global Directory

31	 Hello,  I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you read this, don't feel sorry for me, because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas an Israeli by birth and a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself), but my trade. Though I am very well to do, I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.  I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world, I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent, I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members, as well as a few close friends. I want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far, I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.  I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.  The last of my belonging which no one knows of, is the huge deposit of Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe keeping company abroad, which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.  You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.de  Jaron Abbas

54	 Dear Friend,  I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before. My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.  I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site  http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list  Since the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time.  On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be  recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.  In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me.     The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will facilitate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the only surviving relation to the deceased.  If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.  Upon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction.  I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have been finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business.  Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.

31	Dear, Beloved Friend,   I am Mrs. Susan John from London ; I am married to Mr. John Mike who  worked with London embassy for Ten years before he died in the year 2004.  We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a  brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both  born again Christian.   Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive  he deposited the sum of $9.8Million (NINE Million Eight hundred  thousand U.S.Dollars) with one Bank in London Presently, this money is still  with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for  the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me  most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep  this fund in the Bank   I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for  orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed  is the hand that grivet. I took this decision because I don't have any  child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not  Christians and I don't want my husband&#8217;s efforts to be used by  unbelievers.   I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly  way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death  hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of  the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I  shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this  regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives  around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.  With God all things are possible.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the Bank in London that  you are the beneficiary of the said fund   in London . I will also  issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary  of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me  because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a  worthy Christian.  Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and  truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your  reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Hoping to receive your reply and Remain blessed in the Lord.    Yours in Christ, Mrs. Susan John GREETINGS FROM MRS SUSAN JOHN

47	 Dear,     Due to the on going political crisis in this country (Ivory-Coast-Cote d'Ivoire), I really want to relocate to your country to continue with my education. I was a second year student of Medicine in the university before I lost my parent and since then I have stopped schooling. I have enough money to train myself out of school from an inheritance I inherited from my parent. All I need from you is to accept me and to give me an invitation to help me come over to your country.      I know that this mail may come to you as a surprise. My name is David Djedjess from Congo Republic. But I am presently living in Asylum camp here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire-Ivory coast. I am 23 yrs old. Since no prearrangement was made before the sudden death of my parents in a motor accident, most of our belonging has been confiscated by my wicked uncles whose love of wealth has driven to lose of common sense.      Since after the sudden death of my parents, I’ve learnt a lesson of the real responsibilities of life. Here I am making vital decisions for my future. I had to contact you regardless of the fact that we have not known each other personal, to assist me as my guardian. I prayed over this issue first before my mind was made up to contact you. I really need your help and assistance to help me move US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thousand United states dollars) over to your country for investment and to enable me to continue with my education in your country.      I expect to hear from you soon. In you reply, please tell me more about yourself, are you married with children? what do you do for a living? Waiting for your prompt response.      Remain bless.

32	 My Dear Good Day,                             PLEASE URGENT ATTN.     Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.I am Mr Adams Kabora, The manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank.    In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M, (Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on January 31, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site:  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/   The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will be send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.    The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after nine 9 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than seven to eight years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.    This request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and as an insider i cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be  incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.Upon receipt of your reply.    I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr;Morris Thomson.

46	 My Dear Good Day,                             PLEASE URGENT ATTN.     Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.I am Mr Adams Kabora, The manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank.    In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M, (Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on January 31, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site:  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/   The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will be send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.    The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after nine 9 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than seven to eight years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure.    This request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and as an insider i cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be  incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.Upon receipt of your reply.    I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr;Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email.

33	   Good day,  I am Mr.Christopher Wilson, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you concerning a  deceased customer and an investment he placed under our banks management three years ago.I  Would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect  the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.  I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this  communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of  interest to you. In the year 2003, the subject matter; came to our bank to engage in  business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a  financial portfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us turn  over (invest) on his behalf.  I was the officer assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties  as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector then, especially  given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior  to any investments being placed.I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime  ratings.  In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent  investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He directed that I liquidate the  funds and deposit it with a security firm. I informed him that my Bank would have to make  special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process. Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I  contacted my affiliate and made the funds available to the security firm. I undertook all  the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the  funds deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist private firm that  accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle  valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small  and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited with the  security firm. The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway  later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th of  November 2004.In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us about the  inactivity of that particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I  immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of  Kleinwort Benson.Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our client  was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne,  in Southern part of France.We were soon enough to identify the body and cause of death was  confirmed.   In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a  name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This investigation  has for the past months been unfruitful, We've used our private investigation affiliate  companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my  being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased.  According to practice, The Security Firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a  request for statements of claim to Kleinwort Benson, failing to receive viable claims they  will most probably revert the deposit back to Kleinwort Benson.This will result in the money  entering the Kleinwort Benson accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands  and out of the private banking division.This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish  to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It  is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking  world aberrational.  The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those that occupy  certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together  the general direction of what I propose. There is Six Million dollars deposited in a  security firm, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one  unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as  my Bank  is concerned.  My proposal:I now seek your permission to present you  as a next of kin to the deceased, as  all documentations will be carefully worked to make you the beneficiary to the funds $6,000  000 00 (Six Million United states Dollar) ; I am prepared to place you in a position to  instruct The security Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation.  Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share the money with you. That is: I will  simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share  the proceeds 60/40.I would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that  would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the consequences of this  proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this  mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to  you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.  Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. I am not a criminal and  what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand,  but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come  ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in  total control of my destiny.These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my  chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not  destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new  opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.  I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with  me and alerting my bank.  If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process  towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels;  I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me  through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email  account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this  email address. I do not want any direct link between you and myself.  My official lines are not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our  level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this  instruction religiously.  Please, again, note that I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail  not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing  ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of  gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my  confidence.  Kindly send your response to my private email:christopherwilson77@yahoo.com  I await your response.  Mr.Christopher Wilson

50	To My Beloved Friend I am writing you this mail after several internal battles in me, if i am doing the right thing, as i have gotten your email ever since but i have been hesitating to write you. I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is K I Bakri , a widower and a former oil investor in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. This is a terminal illness that affects the lungs, it has no cure and i am destined to leave this world any moment from now. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Sudan,Indonesia,Norway,Netherland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States of America, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eight Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars($8,500,000) that I have with a Security Company abroad.  What i want to do is to make you the next of Kin/Beneficiary of this diplomatic box kept with the security company and collect the money stashed in the diplomatic box , and thereafter distirbute the money to the less priviledged and hungry. MY health is failing and there is nothing much i can do towards achieving this last wish of mine,all by myself because of my bedridden state in the hospital. I have set aside 30% for your time,service and expenses. N.B:My beloved friend please if you can perform this task ,please do not hesitate to write me,telling me about your passion to help the less-fortunate.     for a faster response  God be with you K I Bakri bakrih10@dynamixmail.com

45	FROM:Mr.Peter Wong Hang Seng Bank Ltd 17 Des Voeux Road Hq Branch. Hong Kong.  This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am Mr. Peter Wong director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 60% for me, 40% for you . Should you be interested please send me:  NAME: CONTACT ADDRESS: PHONE NUMBER : FAX NUMBER IF ANY:   Reply to: pet_wong155@yahoo.com.hk  Finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.

This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address, I got your address from the South African Network Online {SAINO} when I was desperately looking for a trust-worthy person to assist my son who is currently residing in South Africa, and so I decided to contact you. During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members. My husband was one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe�s ideas, Mugabe�s supports invaded my husband farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband farm. Before his death, my husband had deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of (20Million  United States Dollars). After the death of my husband, my son {john} decided to move out of my country to Republic of South Africa where my husband had deposited the money with the Security Company as valuables. Please why I am contacting you is to assist my son to move this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers he is not allowed to operate any Bank Account or assured of security our investment within in the country. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 5% will be out for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction while 75% will be for me and my family which I believe that with your help we will invest it in your country.

I collaborated with the Portuguese Firm on a mutual agreement on the proceed of which I have received my share of 15.5musd.

62	 From: Mr Usman Zongo  African Development Bank (ADB) Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso .    Dear Friend,  I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa .   In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.   Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.   The bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me. As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.   To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.   Hoping to hear from you immediately.   Thanks. Usman Zongo   Get news, entertainment and everything you care about at Live.com.

An Iragi named Fadi Basem,a business man made a numbered fixed deposit  of (346,736,899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months, this is valued to  Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in  my  branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the  war, four years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification  was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that  Fadi Basem and his family had been killed during the war in Gunfire  that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.   After further investigation it was also discovered that Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the  paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last  time  he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my  bank. So, Fourty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State  Dollars is  still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.  What bothers me is that according to the laws of my country at the  expiration five years six months the funds will revert to the ownership   of  the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.   My proposal, We are prepared to place you as the next of kin in a  position to instruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as  the  closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, we am prepared   to  share the money with you on to be agreed on percentages. That is: I  will simply nominate you  as  the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. I would have  gone ahead to ask the funds be released  to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in  claiming the deposit.I assure you that I could have the deposit  released  to you within the coming weeks. I will simply inform the bank of the  final  closing of the file relating to the late customer, I will then  officially  communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the deposit to  you.  With these: all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this  proposal.   I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should  discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive.   If  my offer is of no appeal to you,delete this message and forget I ever  contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of  my  proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made  tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking  sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good  conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of   my  industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come  ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for  once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wont  pass  me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work  with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy  me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with  new  opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well   worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have  here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am  the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you  with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my  life.  Lets share the blessing.   If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a   conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via  official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I  repeat, I  do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I  want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me  only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through the  email account that i will provide therein in this email.   Further more be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives  you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my  deceased client had no relation all his family died with him during the   war and I can not use my relations because its not accepted here in  Hong Kong. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish  the  trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need from the   time been is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in   the next two weeks.   What you need to understand about this transaction is that I will make  sure that it passes through all international banking laws regards to  this I will give the transaction the proper documentation  that is required to perfect the finishing. Your only obligation in this   transaction will be to set up the offshore accounts that can  accommodate these funds and I will give you more light later once you  agree to  partner with me.   Like I said before there is no risk involve as it will pass through  international banking laws and all documents related to this  transaction  will be sent to you by post for your perusal and trust.   I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are   not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level   of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.  Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a   family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not  without a  measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that  nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never  come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned   from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can   be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon. Should you be  interested I will prefer you to reach me via email.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. I await your response. Mr.Cheung mailcheung001@yahoo.com

Direct Telephone; +44-703-189-3319 Direct Fax; +44-700-594-2286     Good Day Dear,  My name is JONATHAN WRIGHT, Principal Partner in CASTLE Law Chambers,  London,UK. I was formally a personal attorney to Mr. Mohammed Saibi who  was the chairman of Algosaibi Diving and marine Services in Dhahran,  Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year of heart attack at the ripe  age of 79 years.  Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist, before he died, made  a Will in my law firm stating that $3.2M (Three million, Two Hundred  Thousand U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any charity home of our  choice overseas as his last contribution to humanity when it became  obvious that he will not stay alive for too long. His only son, Rasheed  Saibi and his entire family has no knowledge of this.  However, I am very much aware that he has left enough wealth that will  last his generation a lifetime. The true situation at the moment is  that the said amount of money was deposited with the BANK here in UK only  to be paid out to a charity home.The charity home/organization would  have to be picked by my law office. This implies that you will stand as  the beneficiary to this Will so that the funds could be processed and  transferred to your account if you are ready and in a position to assist  me. You do not need to have a charity organization, all you need do is  to declare your interest and show seriousness.  As a professional lawyer, I have mapped out strategies which I will use  to obtain all the proper/legal documentations and last approval from  Ministry of Finance concerning the funds which I will send the copies  across to you for your perusal and record puppose before the bank will  contact you.  I am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank  because they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary  of this Will as soon as possible, else the account would be made  dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long period of time before his  demise.If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you 30% of the entire  funds after paying taxes due to your government and expenses incurred  during the course of this transaction. The balance will be mine  although I intend to send some of it to a charity organization.  I urge you to contact me immediately for further details if you are  satisfied with my proposition and feel you are in a position to assist me.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of this transaction.  For the trust I have on you, I believe that you have the ability to  handle this transaction, I will Prefer you respond through this particular  mail or call me on my direct phone indicated above.  Yours faithfully, BARR.JONATHAN WRIGHT Esq. FOR:CASTLE LAW CHAMBERS.

66	Hello,  I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you read this, don't feel sorry for me, because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself), but my trade. Though I am very well to do, I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.  I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world, I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent, I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members, as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far, I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do   this myself anymore.  I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.  The last of my belonging which no one knows of, is the huge deposit of Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe   keeping company abroad, which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.  You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.de  Jaron Abbas

41	Attention please  Compliments to you; I sincerely apologize for the intrude into your private life, however I have a serious project which I believe would be of interest to you and for this reason I reached out to you. I am Barrister Kenneth Obi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folded as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from June 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insurance Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Life policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.  In 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not terminate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  for cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a letter from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for further discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Three Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chairman of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they asked me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.  Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I went back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and senile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to get any of  the Chairman’s relative with his authorization to claim the surrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bearing same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surrender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money would be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I feel it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use some percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.  I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the money if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect and regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to whoever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my file some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim application specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the Insurance Company for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot execute this transaction for any reason, please introduce someone who is capable and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction. Reply urgently if you are interested to execute this with me.   Regards, Barrister Kenneth Obi   More photos; more messages; more whatever – Get MORE with Windows Live™ Hotmail®.

PLEASE FIND FACT ON THE INFORMATION FROM THE WEBSITE BELOW.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4726680.stm  After his painful death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. My Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my partial stroke as a result of high blood pressure.  Having known my condition I decided to donate this funds to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or individual that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.  The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.

44	 From: Mr Ali Sherif.  African Development Bank (ADB) Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso .   Dear Friend,    I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Development Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa .  In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a plane crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.     Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account information died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.     It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or fund.     the bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the transaction on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.   As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.  To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a text of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the bank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private fax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.     Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of application which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the transfer.      You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.  Hoping to hear from you immediately.           PLANE CRASH WEB SITE... http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm   Thanks.

35	 FROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE, LOME- TOGO.      Dear Friend,               I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.      I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.      From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M).      Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.      This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.      May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner.      Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.      All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.    Yours Sincerely,  Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.
